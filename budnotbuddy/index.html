We were all standing in line waiting for breakfast &nbsp;when one of the caseworkers came in and tap-tap-tapped down the line. Uh-oh, &nbsp;this meant bad news, either they&#39;d found a foster home for somebody or &nbsp;somebody was about to get paddled. All the kids watched the woman as she &nbsp;moved along the line, her high-heeled shoes sounding like little fire- crackers &nbsp;going off on the wooden floor. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c593"><span class="c0">Shoot! She stopped at me and said, &quot;Are you Buddy Caldwell?&quot; &nbsp;I said, &quot;It&#39;s Bud, not Buddy, ma&#39;am.&#39;&#39; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c281"><span class="c0">She put her hand on my shoulder and took me out of line. Then she pulled &nbsp;Jerry, one of the littler boys, over. &quot;Aren&#39;t you Jerry Clark?&quot; He nodded. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c120"><span class="c0">&quot;Boys, good news! Now that the school year has ended, you both have been &nbsp;accepted in new temporary- care homes starting this afternoon!&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c0">Jerry asked the same thing I was thinking. &quot;Together?&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c103"><span class="c0">She said, &quot;Why, no. Jerry, you&#39;ll be in a family with three little girls ...&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c675"><span class="c0">Jerry looked like he&#39;d just found out they were going to dip him in a pot of &nbsp;boiling milk. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c540"><span class="c0">&quot;. .. and Bud ...&quot; She looked at some papers she was holding. &quot;Oh, yes, the &nbsp;Amoses, you&#39;ll be with Mr. and Mrs. Amos and their son, who&#39;s twelve years &nbsp;old, that makes him just two years older than you, doesn&#39;t it, Bud?&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c23"><span class="c0">&quot;Yes, ma&#39;am.&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c103"><span class="c0">She said, &quot;I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll both be very happy.&quot; </span></p><p class="c678"><span class="c0">Me and Jerry looked at each other. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c679"><span class="c0">The woman said, &quot;Now, now, boys, no need to look so glum. I know you don&#39;t &nbsp;understand what it means, but there&#39;s a depression going on all over this &nbsp;country. People can&#39;t find jobs and these are very, very difficult times for &nbsp;everybody. We&#39;ve been lucky enough to find two wonderful families who&#39;ve &nbsp;opened their doors for you. I think it&#39;s best that we show our new foster &nbsp;families that we&#39;re very ...&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c320"><span class="c0">She dragged out the word very, waiting for us to finish her sentence for her. &nbsp;Jerry said, &quot;Cheerful, helpful and grateful.&quot; I moved my lips and mumbled. She &nbsp;smiled and said, &quot;Unfortunately, you won&#39;t have time for breakfast. I&rsquo;ll have a &nbsp;couple of pieces of fruit put in a bag. In the meantime go to the sleep room and &nbsp;strip your beds and gather all of your things.&quot; Here we go again. I felt like I was &nbsp;walking in my sleep as I followed Jerry back to the room where all the boys&#39; &nbsp;beds were jim-jammed together. This was the third foster home I was going to &nbsp;and I&#39;m used to packing up and leaving, but it still surprises me that there are &nbsp;always a few seconds, right after they tell you you&#39;ve got to go, when my nose &nbsp;gets all runny and my throat gets all choky and my eyes get all stingy. But the &nbsp;tears coming out doesn&#39;t happen to me anymore, I don&#39;t know when it first &nbsp;happened, but it seems like my eyes don&#39;t cry no more. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c131"><span class="c0">Jerry sat on his bed and I could tell that he was losing the fight not to cry. Tears &nbsp;were popping out of his eyes and slipping down his cheeks. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c361"><span class="c0">I sat down next to him and said, &quot;I know being in a house with three girls &nbsp;sounds terrible, Jerry, but it&#39;s a lot better than being with a boy who&#39;s a couple &nbsp;of years older than you. I&#39;m the one who&#39;s going to have problems. A older boy &nbsp;is going to want to fight, but those little girls are going to treat you real good. &nbsp;They&#39;re going to treat you like some kind of special pet or something.&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c0">Jerry said, &quot;You really think so?&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c668"><span class="c0">I said, &quot;I&#39;d trade you in a minute. The worst thing that&#39;s going to happen to you &nbsp;is that they&#39;re going to make you play house a lot. They&#39;ll probably make you &nbsp;be the baby and will hug you and do this kind of junk to you.&quot; I tickled Jerry &nbsp;under his chin and said, &quot;Ga-ga goo-goo, baby-baby.&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c0">Jerry couldn&#39;t help but smile. I said, &quot;You&#39;re going to be great.&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c667"><span class="c0">Jerry looked like he wasn&#39;t so scared anymore so I went over to my bed and &nbsp;started getting ready. </span></p><p class="c52"><span class="c0">Even though it was me who was in a lot of trouble I couldn&#39;t help but feel sorry &nbsp;for Jerry. Not only because he was going to have to live around three girls, but &nbsp;also because being six is a real rough age to be at. Most folks think you start to &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c495"><span class="c0">be a real adult when you&#39;re fifteen or sixteen years old, but that&#39;s not true, it &nbsp;really starts when you&#39;re around six. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c345"><span class="c0">It&#39;s at six that grown folks don&#39;t think you&#39;re a cute little kid anymore, they talk &nbsp;to you and expect that you understand everything they mean. And you&#39;d best &nbsp;understand too, if you aren&#39;t looking for some real trouble, &#39;cause it&#39;s around six &nbsp;that grown folks stop giving you little swats and taps and jump clean up to &nbsp;giving you slugs that&#39;ll knock you right down and have you seeing stars in the &nbsp;middle of the day. The first foster home I was in taught me that real quick. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c116"><span class="c0">Six is a bad time too &#39;cause that&#39;s when some real scary things start to happen to &nbsp;your body, it&#39;s around then that your teeth start coming a-loose in your mouth. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c321"><span class="c0">You wake up one morning and it seems like your tongue is the first one to &nbsp;notice that something strange is going on, &#39;cause as soon as you get up there it &nbsp;is pushing and rubbing up against one of your front teeth and I&rsquo;ll be doggoned &nbsp;if that tooth isn&#39;t the littlest bit wiggly. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c462"><span class="c0">At first you think it&#39;s kind of funny, but the tooth keeps getting looser and &nbsp;looser and one day, in the middle of pushing the tooth back and forth and &nbsp;squinching your eyes shut, you pull it clean out. It&#39;s the scariest thing you can &nbsp;think of &#39;cause you lose control of your tongue at the same time and no matter &nbsp;how hard you try to stop it, it won&#39;t leave the new hole in your mouth alone, it &nbsp;keeps digging around in the spot where that tooth used to be. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c364"><span class="c0">You tell some adult about what&#39;s happening but all they do is say it&#39;s normal. &nbsp;You can&#39;t be too sure, though, &#39;cause it shakes you up a whole lot more than &nbsp;grown folks think it does when perfectly good parts of your body commence to &nbsp;loosening up and falling off of you. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c658"><span class="c0">Unless you&#39;re as stupid as a lamppost you&#39;ve got to wonder what&#39;s coming off &nbsp;next, your arm? Your leg? Your neck? Every morning when you wake up it &nbsp;seems a lot of your parts aren&#39;t stuck on as good as they used to be. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c350"><span class="c0">Six is real tough. That&#39;s how old I was when I came to live here in the Home. &nbsp;That&#39;s how old I was when Momma died. </span></p><p class="c71"><span class="c0">I folded the blanket and sheet and set them back on the mattress. Then I &nbsp;reached under the bed to get my suitcase. Most of the kids in the Home keep &nbsp;their things in a paper or cloth sack, but not me, I have my own suitcase. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c91"><span class="c0">I set it on the mattress and untied the twine that held it together. I did what I do &nbsp;every night before I go to sleep, I checked to make sure everything was there. &nbsp;The way there&#39;re more and more kids coming into the Home every day, I had to &nbsp;make sure no one had run off with any of my things. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c142"><span class="c0">First I pulled my blanket out and saw that everything was where it was &nbsp;supposed to be. At the bottom of my suitcase were the flyers. I took the blue &nbsp;flyer out and looked at it again. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c698"><span class="c0">The paper was starting to wear out from me looking at it so much but I liked &nbsp;checking to see if there was anything I hadn&#39;t noticed before. It was like some thing was telling me there was a message for me on this flyer but I didn&#39;t have &nbsp;the decoder ring to read what it was. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c379"><span class="c0">Across the top of the flyer writ in big black letters were the words LIMITED &nbsp;ENGAGEMENT, then in little letters it said, &quot;Direct From an S.R.O. &nbsp;engagement in New York City.&quot; Underneath that in big letters again it said, &nbsp;&quot;HERMAN E. CALLOWAY and the Dusky Devastators of the &nbsp;Depression!!!!!!&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c683"><span class="c0">Those six exclamation points made it seem like this was the most important &nbsp;news anyone could think of, seems like you&#39;d have to be really great to deserve &nbsp;all of those exclamation points all stacked up in a row like that. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c562"><span class="c0">Next the paper said, &quot;Masters of the New Jazz: &quot; then in the middle of the flyer &nbsp;was a blurry picture of the man I have a real good suspicion about. I&#39;ve never &nbsp;met him, but I have a pretty good feeling that this guy must be my father. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c267"><span class="c0">In the picture he&#39;s standing next to a giant fiddle that&#39;s taller than him. It looks &nbsp;like it&#39;s real heavy &#39;cause he&#39;s leaning up against it trying to hold it up. He looks &nbsp;like he&#39;s been doing this for a long time and he must be tired &#39;cause he has a &nbsp;droopy, dreamy look on his face. There are two men beside him, one playing &nbsp;drums and the other one blowing a horn. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c133"><span class="c0">It wasn&#39;t hard to see what the guy who must be my father was like just by &nbsp;looking at his picture. You could tell he was a real quiet, real friendly and smart &nbsp;man, he had one of those kind of faces. Underneath the picture someone had </span></p><p class="c722"><span class="c0">writ with a black fountain pen, &quot;One Night Only in Flint, Michigan, at the &nbsp;Luxurious Fifty Grand on Saturday June 16, 1932. 9 Until ?&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c93"><span class="c0">I remember Momma bringing this flyer with her when she came from working &nbsp;one day, I remember because she got very upset when she put it on the supper &nbsp;table and kept looking at it and picking it up and putting it back and moving it &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c634"><span class="c0">around. I was only six then and couldn&#39;t understand why this one got her so &nbsp;upset, she kept four others that were a lot like it in her dressing table, but this &nbsp;one really got her jumpy. The only difference I could see between the blue one &nbsp;and the others was that the others didn&#39;t say anything about Flint on them. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c326"><span class="c0">I remember this blue one too &#39;cause it wasn&#39;t too long after she brought it home &nbsp;that I knocked on Momma&#39;s bedroom door, then found her. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c647"><span class="c0">I put the blue flyer back in the suitcase with the four older ones and put &nbsp;everything back in its place. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c26"><span class="c0">I went over to the big chest of drawers and took my other set of clothes out and &nbsp;put them in the suitcase too. I tied the twine back around my bag, then went and &nbsp;sat on Jerry&#39;s bed with him. Jerry must&#39;ve been thinking just as hard as I was &nbsp;&#39;cause neither one of us said nothing, we just sat close enough so that our &nbsp;shoulders were touching. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c18"><span class="c0">Here we go again. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c190"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c190"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><h1 class="c36 c118 c299" id="h.b56dejokri42"><span class="c5">CHAPTER 2 &nbsp;</span></h1><p class="c285"><span class="c0">THERE COMES A TIME when you&#39;re losing a fight that it just doesn&#39;t make &nbsp;sense to keep on fighting. It&#39;s not that you&#39;re being a quitter, it&#39;s just that you&#39;ve &nbsp;got the sense to know when enough is enough. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c636"><span class="c0">I was having this thought because Todd Amos was hitting me so hard and fast &nbsp;that I knew that the blood squirting out of my nose was only the beginning of a &nbsp;whole long list of bad things that were about to happen to me. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c37"><span class="c0">Todd&#39;s next punch crashed into the side of my ear and I fell on the floor and &nbsp;pulled my knees up to my chest and crossed my arms in front of my head like a &nbsp;turtle in a shell. I started scooching toward the bed hoping I could get under it. </span></p><p class="c239"><span class="c0">Todd started kicking me but his slippers couldn&#39;t hut me near as much as his &nbsp;fists had. The bedroom door opened and his mother, Mrs. Amos, came in. It &nbsp;seemed like she was having a hard time figuring out what was going on &nbsp;because Todd&#39;s right leg got tired from kicking me and he switched over to his &nbsp;left one while she watched. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c0">Finally Mrs. Amos said kind of soft, &quot;Teddy?&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c74"><span class="c0">Todd looked up, fell on his knees and put his hands on his throat. He started &nbsp;huffing and puffing with his eyes bucking out of his head and his chest going &nbsp;up and down so hard that it looked like some kind of big animal was inside of &nbsp;him trying to bust out. This was my chance to get under the bed and pull the &nbsp;covers down so they couldn&#39;t see me. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c194"><span class="c0">Mrs. Amos ran over to her son and fell on her knees. She put her arms around &nbsp;his shoulders. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c563"><span class="c0">&quot;Teddy? Teddy boy, are you all right?&quot; She looked over to where I was peeking &nbsp;from under the bed. &quot;You little cur, what have you done to Teddy?&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c354"><span class="c0">Todd coughed out, &quot;Oh, Mother ...&quot; He took in two jumbo breaths. &quot;I was only &nbsp;trying to help ...&quot; --he was sounding like a horse that had been run too hard in &nbsp;the winter -- &quot;and ... and look what it&#39;s gotten me.&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c171"><span class="c0">Todd pointed at his jaw and Mrs. Amos and me could both see a perfect print in &nbsp;the shape of my hand welted up on Todd&#39;s blubbery cheek. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c603"><span class="c0">With one quick snatch she had me from under the bed and out on the floor &nbsp;laying down next to Todd. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c624"><span class="c0">&quot;How dare you! This is how you choose to repay me? Not only have you struck &nbsp;him, you have provoked his asthma!&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c512"><span class="c0">Todd said, &quot;I just tried to waken him to make sure he&#39;d gone to the lavatory, &nbsp;Mother. I was just trying to help.&quot; He aimed his finger dead at me and said, &nbsp;&quot;And Look at him, Mother, this one&#39;s got &#39;bed wetter&#39; written all over him.&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c200"><span class="c0">I&#39;m not bragging when I say that I&#39;m one of the best liars in the world but I got &nbsp;to tell you, Todd was pretty doggone good. It seemed like he knew some of the &nbsp;same things I know, the things I think of all the time and try to remember so I &nbsp;don&#39;t make the same mistake more than seven or eight times. Shucks, I&#39;ve got &nbsp;so many of them rememorized that I had to give them numbers, and it seemed </span></p><p class="c53"><span class="c0">like Todd knew Number 3 of Bud Caldwell&#39;s Rules and Things for Having a &nbsp;Funner Life and Making a Better Liar Out of Yourself. &nbsp;</span></p><h3 class="c122 c118" id="h.18s4duir1g2h"><span class="c140">RULES AND THINGS NUMBER 3 &nbsp;</span></h3><p class="c36"><span class="c5">If You Got to Tell a Lie Make Sure &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c36"><span class="c5">It&#39;s Simple and Easy to Remember. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c586"><span class="c0">Todd had done that. But this wasn&#39;t really a good test because Mrs. Amos had &nbsp;her ears set to believe anything Todd said. In her eyes Todd&#39;s mouth was a &nbsp;prayer book. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c313"><span class="c0">But I can&#39;t blame Todd for lying like that, having someone who likes you so &nbsp;much that they think everything you say is the truth has got to be a liar&#39;s &nbsp;paradise, that might feel so good it could make you want to quit lying. But &nbsp;maybe not, &#39;cause Todd hadn&#39;t quit lying since the second I came to his house. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c612"><span class="c0">What had really happened was that I woke up from a good sleep because it felt &nbsp;like a steam locomotive had jumped the tracks and chug-chug-chugged its way &nbsp;straight into my nose. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c249"><span class="c0">When I&#39;d jerked up in bed and opened my eyes Todd was standing next to me &nbsp;with a yellow pencil in his hand. He was looking at it like it was a thermometer &nbsp;and said, &quot;Wow! You got all the way up to R!&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c583"><span class="c0">He turned the pencil toward me, crunched up against the headboard. I saw &nbsp;TICONDEROGA printed on the yellow wood. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c386"><span class="c0">The whole room smelled like the rubber from the eraser and I was winking and &nbsp;blinking my left eye because it felt like something had poked the back of my &nbsp;eyeball. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c520"><span class="c0">Todd laughed. &quot;I&#39;ve never gotten it in as deep as the N on any of you other little &nbsp;street urchins. I just might enjoy your stay here. Who knows what other things &nbsp;you could be number one in, Buddy?&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c18"><span class="c0">I&#39;d already told him twice that my name was Bud, not Buddy. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c335"><span class="c0">I didn&#39;t care that Todd Amos was twelve years old, I didn&#39;t care that he was &nbsp;twice as big as me, and I didn&#39;t care that his mother was being paid to take care </span></p><p class="c296"><span class="c0">of me. I wasn&#39;t about to let anybody call me Buddy and stick a pencil up my &nbsp;nose all the way to the R. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c92"><span class="c0">I swung as hard as I could at Todd&#39;s big balloon head. Somewhere between the &nbsp;time I threw my punch and the time it landed my fist came open and when my &nbsp;hand landed it made a pop like a .22 rifle going off. Todd fell on the floor like &nbsp;he&#39;d been coldcocked. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c453"><span class="c0">He sputtered and muttered and felt the spot where I&#39;d slapped him. Then a big &nbsp;smile came on his face and he stood up and started walking real slow toward &nbsp;where I was on the bed. He untied his robe and dropped it on the floor like he &nbsp;was getting ready to do some hard work. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c470"><span class="c0">I jumped to the floor and got my fists up. Todd might&#39;ve been a lot bigger than &nbsp;me but he&#39;d better be ready, this wasn&#39;t going to be a bird&#39;s nest sitting on the &nbsp;ground for him. He could kiss my wrist if he thought I was going to let him &nbsp;whip me up without a good fight. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c507"><span class="c0">Being this brave was kind of stupid. Even though Todd was a puffy, rich old &nbsp;mama&#39;s boy who wore a robe and slippers he could hit like a mule and it wasn&#39;t &nbsp;too long before I&#39;d decided enough was enough. But the story that Mrs. Amos &nbsp;was hearing from her lying son was only that Todd had tried to wake me up so &nbsp;I could go to the bathroom. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c51"><span class="c0">Mrs. Amos hated bed wetters more than anything in the world and my bed had &nbsp;a sticky, hot, smelly rubber baby sheet on it. She&#39;d said it wasn&#39;t anything &nbsp;personal and after I had proved myself for two or three months I could get a &nbsp;proper cloth sheet but until then she had to protect her mattress. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c419"><span class="c0">She pulled Todd to his feet and led him to the door. She looked over at me. &nbsp;&quot;You are a beastly little brute and I will not tolerate even one night with you &nbsp;under my roof. Who knows what you would be capable of while we slept?&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c18"><span class="c0">The door shut behind them and I heard a key jiggle in the lock. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c247"><span class="c0">I plugged the right side of my nose and tried real hard to blow the smell of &nbsp;rubber out of the left side. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c54"><span class="c0">The key jiggled in the lock again. This time when the door opened Mr. Amos &nbsp;was standing with Mrs. Amos. He was carrying my suitcase. Uh-oh, they&#39;d &nbsp;looked inside. I could tell because the twine that held it together was tied in a &nbsp;kind of knot that I didn&#39;t know. </span></p><p class="c41"><span class="c0">This was wrong. They&#39;d promised they&#39;d keep it safe and not look in it. They&#39;d &nbsp;laughed at me when I made them promise: but they did promise. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c446"><span class="c0">&quot;Boy,&quot; Mrs. Amos said, &quot;I am not the least bit surprised at your show of &nbsp;ingratitude. Lord knows I have been stung by my own people before. But take a &nbsp;good look at me because I am one person who is totally fed up with you and &nbsp;your ilk. I do not have time to put up with the foolishness of those members of &nbsp;our race who do not want to be uplifted. In the morning I&rsquo;ll be getting in touch &nbsp;with the Home and, much as a bad penny, you shall be returning to them. I am &nbsp;a woman of my word, though, and you shall not spend one night in my house.&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c245"><span class="c0">She looked at her husband. &quot;Mr. Amos will show you to the shed tonight and &nbsp;you can come back in tomorrow for breakfast before you go. I do hope your &nbsp;conscience plagues you because you may have ruined things for many others. I &nbsp;do not know if I shall ever be able to help another child in need, I do know I &nbsp;shall not allow vermin to attack my poor baby in his own house.&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c660"><span class="c0">She talked like this and she wasn&#39;t even a preacher or a teacher. Shucks, she &nbsp;talked strange like this and she wasn&#39;t even a librarian. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c207"><span class="c0">I only halfway listened to what Mrs. Amos was saying, I was too busy keeping &nbsp;my eye on my suitcase wondering if they&#39;d stolen anything from it. And &nbsp;thinking about getting even. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c31"><span class="c0">When I thought she was done talking I reached my hand out for my suitcase but &nbsp;she told Mr. Amos, &quot;Oh, no. we shall hold on to his beloved valuables.&quot; She &nbsp;laughed. &quot;This shall be our assurance that nothing comes up missing from the &nbsp;house and that this little animal is still here in the morning. He is far too &nbsp;attached to those treasures to go anywhere without them.&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c58"><span class="c0">Mrs. Amos was one of those grown-ups who could always think of one more &nbsp;thing to say. &quot;And that is not all. Before you retire to the shed you shall go to &nbsp;Todd and apologize or I shall be forced to give you the strapping of your life.&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c705"><span class="c0">I&#39;d been so worried about my suitcase that I didn&#39;t even notice the thick black &nbsp;razor strap hanging out of Mrs. Amos&#39;s hand. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c124"><span class="c0">She didn&#39;t have to worry, I&#39;d apologize. One beating from these Amoses was &nbsp;enough for me. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c590"><span class="c0">She grabbed my arm. Mr. Amos walked out of the room with my suitcase, and &nbsp;Mrs. Amos pulled me down the hall to Todd&#39;s room. We stood outside the door </span></p><p class="c584"><span class="c0">listening to Todd groan. When Mr. Amos came back, my suitcase was gone. &nbsp;He&#39;d been so quick that I knew my bag couldn&#39;t be too far away. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c55"><span class="c0">She tapped on Todd&#39;s door and said, &quot;Teddy, may we come in?&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c628"><span class="c0">Todd&#39;s groans got a lot louder. Finally he said, &quot;Yes, Mother&#39;-choke ... cough- &quot;come in.&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c455"><span class="c0">We opened the door and as soon as he saw me Todd got a real terrified look on &nbsp;his face. He scooched up to the headboard and wrapped his arms around his &nbsp;head. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c0">Mrs. Amos gave me a shake and said, &quot;Well?&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c456"><span class="c0">I put my head down and started shooting apologies out like John Dillinger &nbsp;shoots out bullets. I aimed at Todd first. &quot;I know it was wrong of me to hit you. &nbsp;I know you were only trying to help and I&#39;m very sorry for what I did.&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c43"><span class="c0">I looked at Mr. Amos. &quot;And sir, I&#39;m sorry that I got you out of your sleep.&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c359"><span class="c0">He rolled his eyes like that was enough for him. Mrs. Amos was going to be the &nbsp;hardest because just like her ears were set to believe everything that came out &nbsp;of Todd&#39;s lips they were set not to believe anything I said. And if I didn&#39;t lie &nbsp;good enough she was going to use that strap on me. These Amoses might look &nbsp;like a bunch of cream puffs but if she was anything like Todd I bet she could &nbsp;pack a real wallop. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c649"><span class="c0">&quot;And Mrs. Amos, I&#39;m so grateful for all of your help. And I&#39;m really, really &nbsp;sorry&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c314"><span class="c0">I looked up and could see she needed more. &quot;If you give me another chance I &nbsp;promise I&rsquo;ll do a whole lot better. Please don&#39;t call the Home, please don&#39;t send &nbsp;me back.&quot; Shucks, going back to the Home was just what I wanted to do, but I &nbsp;was being just like Brer Rabbit in one of the books Momma used to read to me &nbsp;at night when he yelled out, &quot;Please, Brer Fox, don&#39;t throw me into the pricker &nbsp;patch, please, please!&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c303"><span class="c0">This was another one of Bud Caldwell&#39;s Rules and Things to Have a Funner &nbsp;Life and Make a Better Liar of Yourself. &nbsp;</span></p><h3 class="c179 c118" id="h.13p598n2r9wu"><span class="c140">RULES AND THINGS NUMBER 118 </span></h3><p class="c119"><span class="c5">You Have To Give The Adults Something That &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c36"><span class="c5">They Think They Can Use To Hurt You By Taking It &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c36"><span class="c5">Away.

Mr. Amos, give him the &nbsp;blanket and pillow off the bed he was in and put him in the shed.&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c467"><span class="c0">Todd said, &quot;Yeah, Buddy, keep a sharp eye out for the vampire bats in the &nbsp;shed.&quot; It was like a miracle, Todd&#39;s asthma was gone and he turned into a real &nbsp;chatterbox. &quot;Oh, and watch out for those spiders and centipedes, Buddy. The &nbsp;last kid who got put in there got stung so bad he was swollen up as big as a &nbsp;whale when we got him out in the morning.&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c450"><span class="c0">I guess I didn&#39;t look scared enough &#39;cause Todd kept going. &quot;The kid before that &nbsp;hasn&#39;t been found to this day. All that&#39;s left is that big puddle of his blood on &nbsp;the floor. Isn&#39;t that right, Mother?&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c0">Mrs. Amos said, &quot;Now, Teddy, hush up, you&#39;ll just tire yourself out more.&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c574"><span class="c0">I noticed that she never denied the things Todd had said about the vampires and &nbsp;centipedes and spiders and puddles of blood. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c59"><span class="c0">As I followed Mr. Amos I kept a sharp eye out for my suitcase. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c256"><span class="c0">When we got to the kitchen the first thing I saw was that there was a double barreled shotgun leaning against the side of the icebox. I didn&#39;t have time to &nbsp;wonder why they&#39;d be so scared they&#39;d keep a big gun like that out in the open &nbsp;because I spotted my suitcase slid way under the kitchen table! I didn&#39;t let Mr. &nbsp;Amos know I&#39;d seen it, but it did make me get a lot calmer. We went out of the </span></p><p class="c614"><span class="c0">back kitchen door and down the steps into the dark. We walked around to the &nbsp;back of the shed and he put a key in a padlock. A chain rattled, the lock came &nbsp;off and the door creaked open. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c690"><span class="c0">Even though it was nighttime there was a whole different, scarier kind of dark &nbsp;in the shed. A colder dark with more grays and more shadows. A old smell &nbsp;leaked out and it seemed like it was the perfect smell that all this gray would &nbsp;have. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c294"><span class="c0">Mr. Amos nudged me and I took a baby step into the shed. He could kiss my &nbsp;wrist if he thought I was going to beg him and say things like &quot;I&#39;ll do anything &nbsp;you folks ask me if you don&#39;t lock me up in here all alone.&quot; I squeezed my &nbsp;tongue between my teeth to hold it still &#39;cause I know a lot of times your brain &nbsp;might want to be brave but your mouth might let some real chicken-sounding &nbsp;stuff fall out of it. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c61"><span class="c0">I stood a little bit inside and looked around. Right under the window was a pile &nbsp;of stacked wood. There were a bunch of dusty spiderwebs in front of the little &nbsp;window and someone had pasted old yellow newspapers over the glass so the &nbsp;kids who got locked in here couldn&#39;t peek out. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c279"><span class="c0">Mr. Amos handed me the blanket and pillow and gave me another nudge. I took &nbsp;two more baby steps in. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c423"><span class="c0">I looked down at the floor. If I was like a normal kid I would&#39;ve busted out &nbsp;crying, but I just stood there breathing hard. It was a good thing I&#39;d bit my &nbsp;tongue, because I came real close to saying those stupid begging words to Mr. &nbsp;Amos. Right in the middle of the floor there was a big black stain in the dirt! &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c338"><span class="c0">They really were going to make me sleep in a shed with a patch of blood from &nbsp;that kid who had disappeared out of here a couple of weeks ago! &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c463"><span class="c0">The floor went completely black when Mr. Amos pulled the door shut. I &nbsp;couldn&#39;t see it now, but I&#39;d re-memorized the exact shape the stain was in. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c542"><span class="c0">The padlock snapped shut with the loudest click I&#39;d ever heard. &nbsp;</span></p><h1 class="c118 c489" id="h.yaimhjtp1l6g"><span class="c5">CHAPTER 3 &nbsp;</span></h1><p class="c485"><span class="c0">THE ONLY THING I could hear was my own breath. It was so loud that it &nbsp;sounded like there were six scared people locked up in the shed. </span></p><p class="c703"><span class="c0">I closed my eyes and thought real hard about making my breathing slow down. &nbsp;Pretty soon it sounded like the five other breathers in the shed had left. I was &nbsp;still scared but now it was that get-real excited-and-want-to-move- around kind &nbsp;of scared. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c65"><span class="c0">It didn&#39;t take too long for my eyes to get used to the dark. There was a gray gas &nbsp;can in one corner next to a bunch of gray rakes and a pile of gray rags, and a &nbsp;gray tire next to some gray fishing poles. Maybe Mr. Amos had only pretended &nbsp;to lock the door. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c352"><span class="c0">I reached my hand toward the gray doorknob and quick as that I went from &nbsp;kind of calm to being in that stand-in-one-place-with-spit-drooling-down-the front-of-your-shirt kind of scared. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c276"><span class="c0">Halfway up the door were three little flat monster heads guarding the doorknob. &nbsp;Each head had two little round eyes staring right at me. The eyes were the only &nbsp;thing in the shed that weren&#39;t gray. They were a bright yellow with a big black &nbsp;spot right in the middle. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c417"><span class="c0">I dropped my blanket and pillow and back-stepped until my legs hit the &nbsp;woodpile behind me. From all the fast breathing going on you&#39;da thought the &nbsp;five other scared people had come back and brought a couple of scared friends &nbsp;with them. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c262"><span class="c0">Each head had a wide-open mouth with a sharp set of pointy teeth and lips &nbsp;smiling back ready to bite. It felt like the shed was getting smaller and smaller &nbsp;and the little mouths were getting closer and closer. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c549"><span class="c0">Then I knew what I was looking at. The doorknob guards were three dried-out &nbsp;fish heads that someone had nailed to the door. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c218"><span class="c0">I ran over to the pile of rags and poked at one of them with my shoe to make &nbsp;sure there weren&#39;t any rats or centipedes hiding under it, then I picked it up and &nbsp;hung it over the fish heads so I couldn&#39;t see them and they couldn&#39;t see me. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c710"><span class="c0">I picked up my blanket and pillow and had to decide what was the best way to &nbsp;sleep. I knew the door was no good, I&#39;da bet all sorts of bugs and roaches were &nbsp;crawling around. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">I remember what happened to my best friend, Bugs, when a cockroach crawled &nbsp;in his ear one night at the Home. Four grown folks had held Bugs down whilst &nbsp;they tried to pull it out with a pair of tweezers but the only thing that they did </span></p><p class="c290"><span class="c0">was pull the roach&#39;s back legs off. When they were digging around in Bugs&#39;s &nbsp;ears with the tweezers you&#39;d&#39;ve thought they were pulling his legs off, not some &nbsp;cockroach&#39;s, I&#39;d never heard a kid scream that loud. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c347"><span class="c0">After about fifteen minutes of Bugs screaming the joint down they said they &nbsp;were going to have to take him to the emergency room to get the roach out. It &nbsp;was almost morning when Bugs got back. Everyone was asleep except me. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c157"><span class="c0">I waited until they put him in his bed and turned off the lights. &nbsp;I said, &quot;Did they get it out?&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c229"><span class="c0">He said, &quot;Oh, hi, Bud. Yeah, they got him.&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0">&quot;Did it hurt a lot?&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0">&quot;Nope.&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0">&quot;Were you scared?&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0">&quot;Nope.&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c478"><span class="c0">&quot;Then how come you were screaming so doggone loud?&quot; He said, &quot;I didn&#39;t &nbsp;know I was, I probably couldn&#39;t hear me screaming &#39;cause that roach was so &nbsp;loud.&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c310"><span class="c0">I&#39;d seen lots of roaches but I&#39;d never heard one of them make any sound. I said, &nbsp;&quot;Loud how?&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c96"><span class="c0">&quot;Well, bugs ain&#39;t so different from us as you&#39;d think, soon as he saw those &nbsp;tweezers coming at him he was pretty terrified and commenced to screaming, &nbsp;screaming in English too, not some bug language like you&#39;d expect from a &nbsp;roach.&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c23"><span class="c0">&quot;Yeah? What&#39;d he say?&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c381"><span class="c0">&quot;All he kept yelling was, &#39;My legs! My legs! Why have they done this to my &nbsp;legs?&#39; &quot; That&#39;s the true story about how Bugs started getting called Bugs. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c145"><span class="c0">I&#39;d bet a thousand dollars that there were roaches on the floor of this shed, just &nbsp;waiting to crawl in someone&#39;s ear. And I&#39;d bet those Amoses wouldn&#39;t&#39;ve even &nbsp;tried to pull the roach out, and who knows how long I&#39;d&#39;ve had to listen to some &nbsp;terrified roach screaming his head off right up against my eardrum? </span></p><p class="c111"><span class="c0">I spread the blanket on top of the woodpile and climbed up on it. This put me &nbsp;so I was even with the window. I took a piece of bark and brushed all the &nbsp;spiderwebs from in front of the window, then I put my hand on the glass to see &nbsp;if the newspaper was pasted on from the inside or the outside. I touched paper. &nbsp;I spread my fingers and my hand looked like a yellow-jacket bumblebee, bright &nbsp;yellow with black stripes. This was a great place to have shadow puppets so I &nbsp;made my hand be a wolf and a dog and a duck. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c393"><span class="c0">After while that got to be pretty boring so I scraped at the paper with my &nbsp;fingernails so I could see outside, but I like to keep my nails bit down real low &nbsp;and the paper didn&#39;t budge. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c160"><span class="c0">I took out my jack knife and tried scraping the newspaper with it. The paper &nbsp;peeled away in little curly yellow strips like that stuff rich people throw on &nbsp;New Year&#39;s Eve. I finally got a hole big enough to look out and mashed my eye &nbsp;up against the glass. I could see the back of the Amos house real clean. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c492"><span class="c0">There was a light on. That had to be Mr. and Mrs. Amos&#39;s bedroom. The little &nbsp;bit of light that came through the hole in the paper made me get calm enough &nbsp;that I could lay my head on my pillow and take a nap. WHEN I BLINKED my &nbsp;eyes open, the first thing I noticed was that the light from the Amoses&#39; bedroom &nbsp;was out. The next thing I noticed made me wish I&#39;d stayed asleep. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c112"><span class="c0">Up at the very top of the shed was the biggest vampire bat you&#39;d ever see! He &nbsp;was hanging upside down asleep, but the smell of me rising up to him would &nbsp;probably wake him up at any minute! &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c43"><span class="c0">I reached over to the window and tried to slide it open. It budged an inch. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c94"><span class="c0">I rolled off the woodpile and crawled toward the door with the fish head &nbsp;guards. I reached my hand up and the doorknob turned! Mr. Amos was trying &nbsp;to help me! But after the door opened a crack the padlock and chain on the &nbsp;outside held it tight. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c260"><span class="c0">I looked back up into the rafters to see if the bat had woke up. He was still &nbsp;sound asleep. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c534"><span class="c0">Just like there&#39;s a time that a smart person knows enough is enough, there&#39;s a &nbsp;time when you know you&#39;ve got to fight. I wasn&#39;t about to let this vampire suck &nbsp;my blood dry without a war, he could kiss my wrist if he thought that was &nbsp;going to happen. </span></p><p class="c32"><span class="c0">I got up off my knees and picked up the gray rake. I walked over to the &nbsp;woodpile cool as a cucumber. But inside, every part of my guts was shaking. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c589"><span class="c0">I stood up on the woodpile and held the rake like it was a Louisville Slugger. I &nbsp;eyed where the bat was sleeping and revved the rake like I was going to hit a &nbsp;four-hundred-foot home run. Just before I swung I remembered another one of &nbsp;Bud Caldwell&#39;s Rules and Things for Having a Funner Life and Making a &nbsp;Better Liar Out of Yourself. &nbsp;</span></p><h3 class="c179 c118" id="h.v6r0415x92hy"><span class="c140">RULES AND THINGS NUMBER 328 &nbsp;</span></h3><p class="c36"><span class="c5">When You Make Up Your Mind to Do Something, &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c36"><span class="c5">Hurry Up and Do It, If You Wait You &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c36"><span class="c5">Might Talk Yourself Out or What You &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c36"><span class="c5">Wanted in the First Place. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c357"><span class="c0">Shucks, I couldn&#39;t remember for sure if you killed a vampire by driving a stake &nbsp;in its heart or by shooting it with a silver bullet! &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c312"><span class="c0">If I was wrong and didn&#39;t kill the bat right away I was going to be trapped in the &nbsp;shed with a vampire who was probably going to be real upset that someone had &nbsp;woke him up by whacking him with a rake. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c373"><span class="c0">I took my jackknife out of my pocket and pulled the blade open. That way if I &nbsp;didn&#39;t kill him with the rake and it came down to the two of us tussling on the &nbsp;floor maybe a silver blade in his heart would be just as good as a silver bullet. &nbsp;Unless that was what you had to do with werewolves. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c214"><span class="c0">I raised the rake over my head again, closed my eyes and swung it like I was &nbsp;Paul Bunyan chopping down a tree with one blow. I felt the rake jerk a little &nbsp;when it hit the bat and I opened my eyes just in time to see the vampire get cut &nbsp;right in half. I was kind of surprised it didn&#39;t scream or cry or say, &quot;Curses, you &nbsp;got me!&quot; Instead the only sound I heard was a kind of rattling like a couple of &nbsp;pieces of paper rubbing together or like dry leaves blowing around in the wind. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c33"><span class="c0">The next sound I heard was even worse than if the vampire had said, &quot;Aha, you &nbsp;doggone kid, that hurt, but now I get my revenge!&quot; </span></p><p class="c639"><span class="c0">It sounded like I&#39;d turned on a buzz saw in the shed. All of a sudden it felt like &nbsp;someone had stuck a red-hot nail right into my left cheek. My hand reached up &nbsp;to grab my cheek and I felt something creepy and prickly there. I brought my &nbsp;hand back down and it was holding the biggest, maddest hornet I&#39;d ever seen. I &nbsp;squeezed my hand shut to crush it but it got in another sting on my palm. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c617"><span class="c0">What I&#39;d thought was a vampire bat hanging on the ceiling was really a hornets&#39; &nbsp;nest and now there were about six thousand hornets flying around in the tiny &nbsp;shed and each and every one of them was looking for me! &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c385"><span class="c0">Another fire-nail went into my knee and a second one went into my sock. &nbsp;Maybe this was why the other kid that they&#39;d found in here had been as big as a &nbsp;whale, he was swollen up from all the hornet stings! &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c144"><span class="c0">I dropped my shoulder down and charged at the door with all my might. The &nbsp;door banged against the lock but didn&#39;t budge a inch. All that happened was the &nbsp;rag I&#39;d covered the fish heads with came off and I got bounced back and landed &nbsp;square on the floor. I jumped up again. This time when I charged at the door I &nbsp;put my hand out like Paul Robeson running down the football field. This wasn&#39;t &nbsp;a real good idea, I forgot all about the fish-head door guards. My fingers went &nbsp;right into the mouth of the biggest one and his little needle teeth cut me like a &nbsp;razor. I pulled my hand back and screamed. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c390"><span class="c0">Another hornet buzzed into my ear and it felt like someone had poured hot wax &nbsp;right down into my brain. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c422"><span class="c0">The only thing I could think to do was jump on the woodpile and bust the glass &nbsp;out of the window. I grabbed the handles of the window and gave them one &nbsp;more jerk. I guess being scared gives you a lot of strength because this time the &nbsp;window flew open with a loud bang. Three hornets found me at the same time &nbsp;and all four of us fell out of the window. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c25"><span class="c0">As soon as we hit the ground I rolled as far away from the shed as I could go. I &nbsp;smacked and whacked the hornets that had taken a ride on me and just laid &nbsp;there until I could catch my breath. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c532"><span class="c0">After while the stings and the fish-guard bite quit hurting so much. I started &nbsp;getting madder and madder. I was mad at the Amoses, but most of all I was &nbsp;mad at me for believing there really was a vampire in the shed and for getting &nbsp;trapped like this where there wasn&#39;t anybody who cared what happened to me. </span></p><p class="c328"><span class="c0">I simmered down and started thinking about getting even. I wondered how hard &nbsp;I&#39;d have to pull the trigger (in that double-barrel shotgun for it to go off. I &nbsp;sneaked up the back porch steps to get inside the house. Maybe the vampire bat &nbsp;didn&rsquo;t say it, but the only thought on my mind was.&#39;&#39; Aha. you doggone &nbsp;Amoses, that hurt, but now I get my revenge!&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><h1 class="c179 c118" id="h.di17coe8hmgm"><span class="c5">CHAPTER 4 &nbsp;</span></h1><p class="c80"><span class="c0">THEY HADN&#39;T LOCKED, the kitchen window. It slid open with just a couple &nbsp;of squeaks, then I was inside the Amos house crouched down like a cat burglar, &nbsp;Quick as a rabbit I looked under the table to see if they&#39;d moved my suitcase. It &nbsp;was still there, &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c407"><span class="c0">I got a whole lot calmer when I picked it up and it was the right weight, I didn&#39;t &nbsp;think they&#39;d taken anything out of it. I couldn&#39;t be sure until I looked inside but &nbsp;I could do that later. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c125"><span class="c0">I took in a deep breath and looked over at the icebox to see if the shotgun was &nbsp;still there. I let all the air out in a big puff when I saw it. Shucks, you&#39;d think &nbsp;that with the Amoses being so doggone mean they&#39;d worry about leaving a big &nbsp;old gun like that out in the open. What if one of their visitors got real mad at &nbsp;them about something? I unlocked the back door and set my suitcase on the &nbsp;first step of the porch, so I could make a quick getaway after I was through &nbsp;paying these Amoses back. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c708"><span class="c0">I opened the screen door real quiet and went back into the house. Fair is fair. &nbsp;The Amoses deserved what they were going to get. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c494"><span class="c0">I can&#39;t all the way blame Todd for giving me trouble, though. If I had a regular &nbsp;home with a mother and father I wouldn&#39;t be too happy about other kids living &nbsp;in my house either. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c600"><span class="c0">Being unhappy about it is one thing, but torturing the kids who are there even &nbsp;though they don&#39;t want to be is another. It was my job to make sure other kids &nbsp;who didn&#39;t know where their mothers and fathers were didn&#39;t have to put up &nbsp;with Todd. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c158"><span class="c0">My heart started jumping around in my stomach as soon as I reached out for the &nbsp;shotgun. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c43"><span class="c0">It was a lot longer and heavier than I thought it would be. </span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c0">I lifted it and felt how solid the smooth brown wood was against my shoulder. &nbsp;With it up close to my face like this I could smell the gray metal of the barrel &nbsp;and the gun oil Mr. Amos used on it. I aimed the gun at the stove and pretended &nbsp;I was shooting at a elephant or a dragon or a tiger, or best of all, Todd! &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c336"><span class="c0">I imagined how it would feel to creep up to his bed while he was sleeping and &nbsp;put the shotgun barrel right in his nose. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c396"><span class="c0">After that I&#39;d have to do some quick moving to get the grown-up Amoses. &nbsp;Unless they were real sound sleepers the shotgun going off in Todd&#39;s room &nbsp;would give them a clue that something was going on. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c448"><span class="c0">I lowered the gun. These things were just too dangerous to play with or to take &nbsp;chances with, that&#39;s why the first part of my revenge plan was to get this gun &nbsp;out of the way. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c620"><span class="c0">If something went wrong and the Amoses woke up I didn&#39;t want them rushing &nbsp;down to the kitchen to get the gun. I knew they&#39;d shoot me in a flash and tell &nbsp;the Home it was an accident. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c401"><span class="c0">I took the gun outside and put it on the back porch in a corner where they &nbsp;wouldn&#39;t be able to see it until daytime. I felt a lot better when it was out of my &nbsp;hands. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c595"><span class="c0">When I was back in the kitchen I started opening cupboards looking for the &nbsp;drinking glasses. The first one I opened had the jelly jar they&#39;d given me to &nbsp;drink out of at suppertime. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c665"><span class="c0">I walked over to the sink and turned on one of the spigots. These Amoses had &nbsp;hot water running right into the house! I let it run for a second to warm up and &nbsp;put a dishrag in the bottom of the sink so the splashing wasn&#39;t too loud. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c717"><span class="c0">When the water was good and hot I stuck the jelly jar underneath until it was &nbsp;filled to the brim. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c43"><span class="c0">I started down the hall. Todd&#39;s door came open easy as anything. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c220"><span class="c0">I tiptoed over to his bed. He was deep asleep and his hands were crossed on his &nbsp;chest like he was ready for the graveyard. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c18"><span class="c0">I dipped my middle finger in the water. It felt like the perfect temperature. </span></p><p class="c409"><span class="c0">I held my breath and picked up one of Todd&#39;s chubby hands. One of the older &nbsp;boys at the Home told me if you dipped someone&#39;s hand in a warm glass of &nbsp;water whilst they&#39;re asleep they don&#39;t have any choice but to pee the bed. It&#39;s &nbsp;something about chemistry and biology making some valve in your guts open &nbsp;up and ... woop, zoop, sloop ... you got a wet bed. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c522"><span class="c0">I started to dip Todd&#39;s fingers in the water. But I couldn&#39;t dip more than two &nbsp;fingers at a time. Todd&#39;s bed stayed as dry as the desert. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c696"><span class="c0">I tried holding Todd&#39;s hand flat and pouring water over it but he still didn&#39;t wet &nbsp;the bed. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c398"><span class="c0">Finally I decided to just pour the water on his pajama pants. &nbsp;I pulled the blanket and sheet down and emptied the jar. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c566"><span class="c0">His face twitched a couple of times and for a minute it looked like his eyes &nbsp;were going to come open but they stayed shut. He smiled and the warm water &nbsp;from the jelly jar opened that little valve up and ... woop, zoop, sloop ... he &nbsp;soaked his sheets! &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c18"><span class="c0">I tiptoed out of the room and down the hall and out the door. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c713"><span class="c0">My favorite saying in the whole world is &quot;He who laughs last laughs best&rdquo; so I &nbsp;put my hand over my mouth and whispered, &quot;Ha-ha-ha.&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c18"><span class="c0">I picked up my suitcase and walked to the street. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c42"><span class="c0">Man! I was on the lam, I was just like Public Enemy Number One. If J. Edgar &nbsp;Hoover and the FBI saw me now I&#39;d be in some real serious hot water! &nbsp;</span></p><h1 class="c122 c118" id="h.azdmvfw1h4u8"><span class="c5">CHAPTER 5 &nbsp;</span></h1><p class="c184"><span class="c0">BEING ON THE LAM was a whole lot of fun ... for about five minutes. Every &nbsp;time my heart beat I could feel the blood pushing hot and hard on the inside of &nbsp;my sting spots and the bite on my hand. But I couldn&#39;t let that slow me down, I &nbsp;had to get out of this neighborhood as quick as I could. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c251"><span class="c0">I knew a nervous-looking, stung-up kid with blood dripping from a fish-head &nbsp;bite and carrying a old raggedy suitcase didn&#39;t look like he belonged around &nbsp;here. The only hope I had was the north side library. If I got there maybe Miss &nbsp;Hill would be able to help me, maybe she&#39;d understand and would be able to </span></p><p class="c173"><span class="c0">tell me what to do. And for now I could sneak into the library&#39;s basement to &nbsp;sleep. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c551"><span class="c0">It was a lot later than I&#39;d ever been up before and I was kind of scared of the &nbsp;cops catching me. I had to be real careful, even if it was the middle of the night, &nbsp;even if I was crouching down, sneaking along the street like Pretty Boy Floyd. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c676"><span class="c0">At the library I walked past a row of giant Christmas trees that were planted on &nbsp;the side of the building. There was a door on the side with a light burning &nbsp;above it so I kept walking in the shadows made by the big trees. When I got to &nbsp;the back windows, I almost busted out crying. Somebody had gone and put big &nbsp;metal bars on the windows. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c513"><span class="c0">Even though I knew it was useless I tried tugging at the bars but they were the &nbsp;real McCoy, solid steel. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c127"><span class="c0">I headed back to the Christmas trees. They were low enough to the ground that &nbsp;no one could see me unless they were really looking, so I started opening my &nbsp;suitcase. Most folks don&#39;t have sense enough to carry a blanket around with &nbsp;them, but you never know when you might be sleeping under a Christmas tree &nbsp;at the library so I always keep mine handy. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c286"><span class="c0">I untied the strange knots that the Amoses had put in my twine and opened the &nbsp;suitcase. I could tell right away that someone had been fumbling through my &nbsp;things. First off, whenever I put the blanket in, I always fold it so that it stops &nbsp;all the other things from banging up against each other, but those doggone &nbsp;Amoses had just stuffed it in without paying no mind to what it was mashing &nbsp;up against. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c136"><span class="c0">I lifted the blanket out and saw that everything else was still there. You might &nbsp;be able to say that the Amoses were some mean old nosy folks, but you &nbsp;couldn&#39;t call them thieves. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I picked up the old tobacco bag that I keep my rocks in. I could tell by the way &nbsp;the drawstring was pulled that the Amoses had been poking through this too. I &nbsp;jiggled it up and down in my hand a couple of times and it felt like none of the &nbsp;rocks was missing but I opened it to count them anyway. None of them was &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c643"><span class="c0">gone. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c592"><span class="c0">Next I pulled Momma&#39;s picture out of the envelope I kept it in and held it so the &nbsp;light from the Library&#39;s side door would shine down on it. It looked like the &nbsp;Amoses hadn&#39;t hurt it. This was the only picture of Momma in the world. </span></p><p class="c228"><span class="c0">Running across the top of it was a sign that was writ on a long skinny flag, it &nbsp;said, BOYS AND GIRLS--FOLLOW THE GENTLE LIGHT TO THE MISS &nbsp;B. GOTTEN MOON PARK. Underneath the sign, between two big wagon &nbsp;wheels, was Momma. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c554"><span class="c0">She was about as old as I am now and was looking down and frowning. I can&#39;t &nbsp;understand why she was so unhappy, this park looked like the kind of place &nbsp;where you could have a lot of fun. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c552"><span class="c0">In the picture Momma was sitting on a real live little midget horse. It looked &nbsp;tired and dragged out like those big workhorses do, but it had a teeny-tiny body &nbsp;with a big sag where most horses have a straight back. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c544"><span class="c0">Momma was sitting right in the middle of the horse&#39;s back, riding him &nbsp;sidesaddle, except there wasn&#39;t any saddle so I guess you have to say she was &nbsp;riding him side-sag. She had two six-shooter pistols in her hands and the way &nbsp;her face looked you could tell she wished she could&#39;ve emptied them on &nbsp;somebody. And I know who that somebody was. Momma told me it was her &nbsp;father, my granddad. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c627"><span class="c0">He&#39;d gone and ruined everybody&#39;s fun that day by getting in a big fight with my &nbsp;mother about the gigantic white twenty-five-gallon Texas cowboy hat that she &nbsp;was wearing. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c211"><span class="c0">Momma used to tell me, &quot;That hardheaded man insisted, insisted mind you, that &nbsp;I wear that horrible hat.&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c687"><span class="c0">The hat was almost as big as Momma and you could see it was fake because as &nbsp;tall as it was no real cowboy could&#39;ve wore it without getting it knocked off his &nbsp;head every time he rode under a tree or some telegraph wires. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c83"><span class="c0">Momma told me that some man used to drag the midget horse all through her &nbsp;neighborhood with a camera and if your momma or daddy signed a piece of &nbsp;paper he&#39;d take some pictures of you, then come back in a couple of weeks so &nbsp;you could buy them. Momma wasn&#39;t looking like she had rocks in her jaw &nbsp;because the hat was so fake that a real cowboy would&#39;ve laughed you out of &nbsp;town for wearing it, she was mad because the hat was so dirty. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c75"><span class="c0">When she used to tell me about it her eyes would get big and bunny, like the &nbsp;whole thing happened the day before yesterday instead of all those years ago. &nbsp;She&#39;d start moving around our apartment real quick, picking things up and &nbsp;putting them back in the exact same spot. </span></p><p class="c653"><span class="c0">&quot;Filth!&quot; she&#39;d say about the hat. &quot;Absolute filth! Why, the thing was positively &nbsp;alive with germs! Who knows what type of people had worn it?&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c43"><span class="c0">I&#39;d say, &quot;I don&#39;t know, Momma?&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c498"><span class="c0">She&#39;d say, &quot;Who knows how many years it had been worn by who knows how &nbsp;many sweaty little heads?&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c18"><span class="c0">I&#39;d say, &quot;I don&#39;t know, Momma&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c582"><span class="c0">She&#39;d say, &quot;The entire band on the inside was black and I&#39;m sure it was &nbsp;crawling with ringworm, lice and tetters!&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c43"><span class="c0">I&#39;d say, &quot;Yes, Momma&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c656"><span class="c0">She&#39;d say, &quot;And that horrid little photographer didn&#39;t care, do you imagine it &nbsp;ever occurred to him to wash it?&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c18"><span class="c0">I&#39;d say, &quot;No, Momma.&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c472"><span class="c0">She&#39;d say, &quot;Of course not, we meant less to him than that horse he mistreated &nbsp;so.&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c43"><span class="c0">I&#39;d say, &quot;Yes, Momma.&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c206"><span class="c0">She&#39;d say, &quot;But your grandfather insisted. To this day I cannot understand why, &nbsp;but he insisted, insisted ...&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c609"><span class="c0">I&#39;d say, &quot;Yes, Momma.&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c132"><span class="c0">We had that conversation a lot of times. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c130"><span class="c0">Me and Momma having the same conversations lots of times is one of the main &nbsp;things I can remember about her now. Maybe that&#39;s because when she&#39;d tell me &nbsp;these things she used to squeeze my arms and look right hard in my face to &nbsp;make sure I was listening, but maybe I remember them because those arm squeezing, face-looking times were the only times that things slowed down a &nbsp;little bit when Momma was around. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c720"><span class="c0">Everything moved very, very fast when Momma was near, she was like a &nbsp;tornado, never resting, always looking around us, never standing still. The only &nbsp;time stuff didn&#39;t blow around when she was near was when she&#39;d squeeze my &nbsp;arms and tell me things over and over and over and over. </span></p><p class="c466"><span class="c0">She had four favorite things to tell me, one of them was about the picture and &nbsp;another one was about my name. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c428"><span class="c0">She&#39;d say, &quot;Bud is your name and don&#39;t you ever let anyone call you anything &nbsp;outside of that either.&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c137"><span class="c0">She&#39;d tell me, &quot;Especially don&#39;t you ever let anyone call you Buddy, I may have &nbsp;some problems but being stupid isn&#39;t one of them, I would&#39;ve added that </span><span class="c377 c560">dy </span><span class="c0">onto &nbsp;the end of your name if I intended for it to be there. I knew what I was doing, &nbsp;Buddy is a dog&#39;s name or a name that someone&#39;s going to use on you if they&#39;re &nbsp;being false-friendly. Your name is Bud, period.&quot; I&#39;d say, &quot;OK, Momma.&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c0">And she&#39;d say, every single time, &quot;And do you know what a bud is?&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c511"><span class="c0">I always answered, &quot;Yes, Momma&quot; but it was like she didn&#39;t hear me, she&#39;d tell &nbsp;me anyway. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c128"><span class="c0">&quot;A bud is a flower-to-be. A flower-in-waiting. Waiting for just the right &nbsp;warmth and care to open up. It&#39;s a little fist of love waiting to unfold and be &nbsp;seen by the world. And that&#39;s you.&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c43"><span class="c0">I&#39;d say, &quot;Yes, Momma.&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c339"><span class="c0">I know she didn&#39;t mean anything by naming me after a flower, but it&#39;s sure not &nbsp;something I tell anybody about. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c408"><span class="c0">Another thing she&#39;d tell me was, &quot;Don&#39;t you worry, Bud, as soon as you get to &nbsp;be a young man I have a lot of things I&rsquo;ll explain to you.&quot; That didn&#39;t make me &nbsp;calm at all, that was Bud Caldwell&#39;s Rules and Things to Have a Funner Life &nbsp;and Make a Better Liar Out of Yourself Number 83. &nbsp;</span></p><h3 class="c179 c118" id="h.fh9r0u5l8a6f"><span class="c140">RULES AND THINGS NUMBER 83 &nbsp;</span></h3><p class="c36"><span class="c5">If an Adult Tells You Not to Worry, and &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c36"><span class="c5">You Weren&#39;t Worried Before, You Better Hurry &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c36"><span class="c5">Up and Start &#39;Cause You&#39;re Already Running Late. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c242"><span class="c0">She&#39;d tell me, &quot;These things I&#39;m going to explain to you later will be a great &nbsp;help for you.&quot; Then Momma&#39;d look hard in my face, grab a hold of my arms &nbsp;real tight and say, &quot;And Bud, I want you always to remember, no matter how </span></p><p class="c403"><span class="c0">bad things look to you, no matter how dark the night, when one door closes, &nbsp;don&#39;t worry, because another door opens.&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c43"><span class="c0">I&#39;d say, &quot;What, it opens all by itself?&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c103"><span class="c0">She&#39;d say, &quot;Yes, it seems so.&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c388"><span class="c0">That was it: &quot;Another door opens.&quot; That was the thing that was supposed to &nbsp;have helped me. I should&#39;ve known then that I was in for a lot of trouble. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c73"><span class="c0">It&#39;s funny how now that I&#39;m ten years old and just about a man I can see how &nbsp;Momma was so wrong. She was wrong because she probably should&#39;ve told me &nbsp;the things she thought I was too young to hear, because now that she&#39;s gone I&rsquo;ll &nbsp;never know what they were. Even if I was too young back then I could&#39;ve &nbsp;rememorized them and used them when I did need help, like right now. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c637"><span class="c0">She was also wrong when she thought I&#39;d understand that nonsense about doors &nbsp;closing and opening all by themselves. Back then it really scared me because I &nbsp;couldn&#39;t see what one door closing had to do with another one opening unless &nbsp;there was a ghost involved. All her talk made me start jamming a chair up &nbsp;against my closet door at night. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c480"><span class="c0">But now that I&#39;m almost grown I see Momma wasn&#39;t talking about doors &nbsp;opening to let ghosts into your bedroom, she meant doors like the door at the &nbsp;Home closing leading to the door at the Amoses&#39; opening and the door in the &nbsp;shed opening leading to me sleeping under a tree getting ready to open the next &nbsp;door. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c355"><span class="c0">I checked out the other things in my suitcase and they seemed OK. I felt a lot &nbsp;better. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c613"><span class="c0">Right now I was too tired to think anymore so I closed my suitcase, put the &nbsp;proper knots back in the twine, crawled under the Christmas tree and wrapped &nbsp;myself in the blanket. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c356"><span class="c0">I&#39;d have to wake up real early if I wanted to get to the mission in time for &nbsp;breakfast, if you were one minute late they wouldn&#39;t let you in for food. &nbsp;</span></p><h1 class="c179 c118" id="h.dsamcv3tfhni"><span class="c5">CHAPTER 6 &nbsp;</span></h1><p class="c178"><span class="c0">UH-OH. My eyes opened and I could see the sun behind the branch of a &nbsp;Christmas tree. </span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">I jumped up, folded my blanket inside my suitcase, hid it and started running &nbsp;the six or seven blocks down to the mission. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c227"><span class="c0">I turned the corner and said, &quot;Whew!&quot; There were still people lined up waiting. &nbsp;I started walking along the line. The end was a lot farther away than I thought. &nbsp;The line turned all the way around two corners, then crossed over one street &nbsp;before I saw the last person. Shucks. I walked up to get behind him. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c447"><span class="c0">He said, &quot;Line&#39;s closed. These here fouls are the last ones.&quot; He pointed at a man &nbsp;standing next to a woman who was carrying a baby. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c43"><span class="c0">I said, &quot;But sir ...I&#39; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c69"><span class="c0">He said, &quot;But nothing. Line&#39;s closed. These here folks are the last ones.&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">It was time to start lying. If I didn&#39;t get any food now I&#39;d have to steal &nbsp;something out of someone&#39;s garbage or I wouldn&#39;t be able to eat until the &nbsp;mission opened for supper. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c18"><span class="c0">I said, &quot;Sir, I--&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c81"><span class="c0">The man raised his hand and said, &quot;Look, kid, everybody&#39;s got a story and &nbsp;everybody knows the rules. The line closes at seven o&#39;clock. How&#39;s it fair to &nbsp;these people who been here since five o&#39;clock that you can sleep until&quot; -- he &nbsp;looked at his wristwatch--&quot;until seven-fifteen, then come busting down here &nbsp;expecting to eat? You think you got some kind of special privilege just &#39;cause &nbsp;you&#39;re skinny and raggedy? Look in the line, there&#39;s lots of folks look just like &nbsp;you, you ain&#39;t the worst. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c642"><span class="c0">&quot;Supper starts at six P.M., but you see how thing&rsquo;s is, if you plan on getting fed &nbsp;you better be in line by four. Now get out of here before 1 get rough with you.&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c523"><span class="c0">Shucks, being hungry for a whole day is about as bad as it can get. I said. &quot;But &nbsp;...&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c646"><span class="c0">He reached in his pocket and pulled something out that looked like a heavy &nbsp;black strap and slapped it across his hand. Uh-oh, here we go again. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c329"><span class="c0">He said. &quot;That&#39;s it, no more talk, you opened your mouth one time too many. &nbsp;You rotten kids today don&#39;t listen to no one, but I&#39;m a show you something &nbsp;that&#39;ll improve your hearing.&#39;&#39; He slapped the strap on his hand and started &nbsp;walking toward me. </span></p><p class="c274"><span class="c0">I was wrong when I said being hungry for a day is about as bad as it can get, &nbsp;being hungry plus having a big knot on your head from a black leather strap &nbsp;would be even worse. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c98"><span class="c0">I backed away but only got two steps before I felt a giant warm hand wrap &nbsp;around my neck from behind. I looked up to see whose doggone hand was so &nbsp;doggone big and why they&#39;d put it around my neck. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c576"><span class="c0">A very tall, square-shaped man in old blue overalls looked down at me and &nbsp;said, &quot;Clarence, what took you so long?&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c606"><span class="c0">I got ready to say, &quot;My name&#39;s not Clarence and please don&#39;t choke me, sir, I&#39;ll &nbsp;leave&rdquo; but as soon as I opened my mouth he gave my head a shake and said, &quot;I &nbsp;told you to hurry back, now where you been?&quot; He gave me a shove and said, &nbsp;get back in line with your momma.&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c501"><span class="c0">I looked up and down the line to see who was supposed to be my momma when &nbsp;a woman pointed her finger at her feet and said, &quot;Clarence, you get over here &nbsp;right now.&quot; There were two little kids hanging on to her skirt. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c686"><span class="c0">I walked over to where she was and she gave me a good hard smack on the &nbsp;head. Shucks, for someone who was just pretending to be my momma she sure &nbsp;did slap me a good one. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c18"><span class="c0">I said, &quot;Ow!&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c707"><span class="c0">The big square man who&#39;d grabbed my neck looked at the man with the strap &nbsp;and said, &quot;Boy had to go use the capper, told him not to waste time, but like &nbsp;you said, these kids today don&#39;t listen to nobody.&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c458"><span class="c0">The strap man looked at the size of the man who called me Clarence and &nbsp;walked back to the end of the line. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c482"><span class="c0">When the overall man got back in line I said, &quot;Thank you, sir, I really tried to &nbsp;get&hellip;&quot; But he popped me in the back of the head, hard, and said, &quot;Next time &nbsp;don&#39;t be gone so long.&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c538"><span class="c0">The two little kids busted out laughing and said, &quot;Nyah-nyah-nyah-nyah-nyah, &nbsp;Clarence got a lickin&#39;, Clarence got a lickin&#39;.&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c444"><span class="c0">I told them, &quot;Shut up, and don&#39;t call me&hellip;&quot; Then both my pretend poppa and &nbsp;my pretend momma smacked my head. </span></p><p class="c526"><span class="c0">She looked at the people direct behind us and said, &quot;Mercy, when they get to be &nbsp;this age ...&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c716"><span class="c0">The people weren&#39;t too happy about me taking cuts in the line, but when they &nbsp;looked at how big my pretend daddy was and they saw how hard him and my &nbsp;pretend momma were going upside my head they decided they wouldn&#39;t say &nbsp;anything. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c452"><span class="c0">I was grateful to these people, but I wished they&#39;d quit popping me in the head, &nbsp;and it seems like with all the names in the world they could&#39;ve come up with a &nbsp;better one for me than Clarence. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c306"><span class="c0">I stood in line with my pretend family for a long, long time. Everybody was &nbsp;very quiet about standing in line, even my pretend brother and sister and all the &nbsp;other kids. When we finally got around the last comer and could see the door &nbsp;and folks going in it seemed like a bubble busted and people started laughing &nbsp;and talking. The main thing people were talking about was the great big sign &nbsp;that was hanging over the building. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c238"><span class="c0">It showed a gigantic picture of a family of four rich white people sitting in a car &nbsp;driving somewhere. You could tell it was a family &#39;cause they all looked &nbsp;exactly alike. The only difference amongst them was that the daddy had a big &nbsp;head and a hat and the momma had the same head with a woman&#39;s hat and the &nbsp;girl had two big yellow pigtails coming out from above her ears. They all had &nbsp;big shiny teeth and big shiny eyes and big shiny cheeks and big shiny smiles. &nbsp;Shucks, you&#39;d need to squint your eyes if that shiny family drove anywhere &nbsp;near you. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c469"><span class="c0">You could tell they were rich &#39;cause the car looked like it had room for eight or &nbsp;nine more people in it and &#39;cause they had movie star clothes on. The woman &nbsp;was wearing a coat with a hunk of fur around the neck and the man was &nbsp;wearing a suit and a tie and the kids looked like they were wearing ten-dollar apiece jackets. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c439"><span class="c0">Writ about their car in fancy letters it said, THERE IS NO PLACE LIKE &nbsp;AMERICA TODAY! &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c292"><span class="c0">My pretend daddy read it and said, &quot;Uh-uh-uh, well, you got to give them &nbsp;credit, you wouldn&#39;t expect that they&#39;d have the nerve to come down here and &nbsp;tell the truth.&quot; </span></p><p class="c561"><span class="c0">When we finally got into the building it was worth the wait. The first thing you &nbsp;noticed when you got inside was how big the place was, and how many people &nbsp;were in it and how quiet it was. The only sound you could hear was when &nbsp;someone scraped a spoon across the bottom of their bowl or pulled a chair in or &nbsp;put one back or when the people in front of you dragged their feet on the floor &nbsp;moving up to where they were spooning out the food. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c35"><span class="c0">After we&#39;d picked up our spoons and bowls a lady dug a big mess of oatmeal &nbsp;out of a giant pot and swopped it down into our bowls. She smiled and said, &quot;I &nbsp;hope you enjoy?&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c226"><span class="c0">Me and my pretend family all said, &quot;Thank you, ma&#39;am&quot;. Then a man put two &nbsp;pieces of bread and a apple and a big glass of milk on your tray and said, &nbsp;&quot;Please read the signs to your children. Thank you.&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c436"><span class="c0">We all said &quot;Thank you, sir.&quot; Then we walked past some signs someone&#39;d stuck &nbsp;up on the wall. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c234"><span class="c0">One said, PLEASE DO NOT SMOKE, another said PLEASE EAT AS &nbsp;QUICKLY AND QUIETW AS POSSIBLE, another one said, PLEASE BE &nbsp;CONSIDERATE AND PATIENT--CLEAN UP AFTER YOURSELF--YOUR &nbsp;NEIGHBORS WILL BE EATING AFTER YOU, and the last one said, we &nbsp;ARE TERRIBLY SORRY BUT WE HAVE NO WORK AVAILABLE. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c17"><span class="c0">My pretend daddy read the signs to my pretend brother and sister and we all sat &nbsp;at a long table with strangers on both sides of us. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c518"><span class="c0">The oatmeal was delicious! I poured some of my milk into it so it wouldn&#39;t be &nbsp;so lumpy and mixed it all together. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c102"><span class="c0">My pretend mother opened her pocketbook and took out a little brown &nbsp;envelope. She reached inside of it and sprinkled something on my pretend &nbsp;brother&#39;s and sister&#39;s oatmeal, then said to them, &quot;I know that&#39;s not as much as &nbsp;you normally get, but I wanted to ask you if you minded sharing some with &nbsp;Clarence.&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c410"><span class="c0">They pouted and gave me a couple of dirty looks. My pretend mother said, &nbsp;&quot;Good,&quot; and emptied the rest of the envelope over my oatmeal. Brown sugar! &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c569"><span class="c0">Shucks, I didn&#39;t even mind them calling me Clarence anymore. I said &quot;Thank &nbsp;you, Momma, ma&#39;am.&quot; </span></p><p class="c461"><span class="c0">She and my pretend daddy laughed and he said, &quot;It took you long enough to &nbsp;catch on, Clarence.&quot; He acted like he was going to smack me again but he &nbsp;didn&#39;t. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c152"><span class="c0">After we&#39;d finished all our food we put our bowls up and I thanked my pretend &nbsp;family again, I asked them, &quot;Are you going to be coming back for supper?&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c348"><span class="c0">My pretend momma said, &quot;No, dear, we only come here mornings. But you &nbsp;make sure you get here plenty early, you hear?&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c579"><span class="c0">I said, &quot;Yes, Momma, I mean, ma&#39;am&quot;. I watched them walking away. My &nbsp;pretend brother looked back at me and stuck out his tongue, then reached up &nbsp;and took my pretend mother&#39;s hand. I couldn&#39;t really blame him, I don&#39;t think I&#39;d &nbsp;be real happy about sharing my brown sugar and my folks with any strange &nbsp;kids either. &nbsp;</span></p><h1 class="c179 c118" id="h.z3mv6c9af1lo"><span class="c5">CHAPTER 7 &nbsp;</span></h1><p class="c724"><span class="c0">I PUSHED the heavy door open and walked into the library. The air in the &nbsp;library isn&#39;t like the air anywhere else, first it&#39;s always cooler than the air &nbsp;outside, it feels like you&#39;re walking into a cellar on a hot July day, even if you &nbsp;have to walk up a bunch of stairs to get into it. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c146"><span class="c0">The next thing about the air in the library is that no other place smells anything &nbsp;like it. If you close your eyes and try to pick out what it is that you&#39;re sniffing &nbsp;you&#39;re only going to get confused, because all the smells have blended together &nbsp;and turned themselves into a different one. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c555"><span class="c0">As soon as I got into the library I closed my eyes and took a deep breath. I got a &nbsp;whiff of the leather on all the old books, a smell that got real strong if you &nbsp;picked one of them up and stuck your nose real close to it when you turned the &nbsp;pages. Then there was the smell of the cloth that covered the brand-new books, &nbsp;the books that made a splitting sound when you opened them. Then I could &nbsp;sniff the paper, that soft, powdery, drowsy smell that comes off the pages in &nbsp;little puffs when you&#39;re reading something or looking at some pictures, a kind &nbsp;of hypnotizing smell. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c565"><span class="c0">I think it&#39;s that smell that makes so many folks fall asleep in the library. You&#39;ll &nbsp;see someone turn a page and you can imagine a puff of page powder coming up &nbsp;really slow and easy until it starts piling on the person&#39;s eye- lashes, weighing &nbsp;their eyes down so much that they stay down a little longer after each blink and &nbsp;finally making them so heavy that they just don&#39;t come back up at all. Then </span></p><p class="c395"><span class="c0">their mouths come open and their heads start bouncing up and down like they&#39;re &nbsp;bobbing in a big tub of water for apples and before you know it,... woop, zoop, &nbsp;sloop . . they&#39;re out cold and their face thunks down smack-dab on the book. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c77"><span class="c0">That&#39;s the part that gets the librarians the maddest, they get real upset if folks &nbsp;start drooling in the books and, page powder or not, they don&#39;t want to hear no &nbsp;excuses, you gotta get out. Drooling in the books is even worse than laughing &nbsp;out loud in the library, and even though it might seem kind of mean, you can&#39;t &nbsp;really blame the librarians for tossing drooly folks out &#39;cause there&#39;s nothing &nbsp;worse than opening a book and having the pages all stuck together from &nbsp;somebody&#39;s dried-up slobber. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c433"><span class="c0">I opened my eyes to start looking for Miss Hill. She wasn&#39;t at the lending desk &nbsp;so I left my suitcase with the white lady there. I knew it would be safe. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c702"><span class="c0">I walked between the stacks to see if Miss Hill was putting books up. Three &nbsp;doggone times I walked through the library, upstairs and down, and couldn&#39;t &nbsp;find her. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c108"><span class="c0">I went back up to the librarian at the lending desk. I waited until she looked up &nbsp;at me. She smiled and said, &quot;Yes? Would you like to retrieve your suitcase?&quot; &nbsp;She reached under the desk. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c18"><span class="c0">I said, &quot;Not yet, ma&#39;am, could I ask you a question?&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c103"><span class="c0">She said, &quot;Of course, young man, how may I help you?&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0">&quot;I&#39;m looking for Miss Hill.&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c69"><span class="c0">The librarian looked surprised. &quot;Miss Hill? My goodness, hadn&#39;t you heard?&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c380"><span class="c0">Uh-oh ! That&#39;s Number 16 of Bud Caldwell&#39;s Rules and Things for Having a &nbsp;Funner Life and Making a Better Liar Out of Yourself, that&#39;s one of the worst &nbsp;ones. &nbsp;</span></p><h3 class="c179 c118" id="h.apnadf5nrcu7"><span class="c140">RULES AND THINGS NUMBER 16 &nbsp;</span></h3><p class="c36"><span class="c5">If a Grown-up Ever Starts a Sentence by Saying &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c36"><span class="c5">&quot;Haven&#39;t You Heard, &quot;Get Ready, &#39;Cause &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c36"><span class="c5">What&#39;s About to Come Out of Their Mouth Is Gonna </span></p><p class="c119"><span class="c5">Drop You Head first into a Boiling Tragedy. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c712"><span class="c0">It seems like the answer to &quot;Haven&#39;t you heard&quot; always has something to do &nbsp;with someone kicking the bucket. And not kicking the bucket in a calm, &nbsp;peaceful way like a heart attack at home in bed either, it usually is some kind of &nbsp;dying that will make your eyes buck out of your head when you hear about it, &nbsp;it&#39;s usually the kind of thing that will run you out of a room with your hands &nbsp;over your ears and your mouth wide open. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0">Something like hearing that your grandmother got her whole body pulled &nbsp;through the wringer on a washing machine, or something like hearing about a &nbsp;horse slipping on the ice and landing on some kid you went to school with. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c129"><span class="c0">I answered, &quot;No, ma&#39;am,&quot; and got my stomach ready to hear about Miss Hill &nbsp;biting the dust in some way that was going to give me nightmares. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c460"><span class="c0">The librarian said, &quot;There&#39;s no need for you to look so stricken. It&#39;s not bad &nbsp;news, young man.&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c389"><span class="c0">She laughed a quiet, librarian-type laugh and said, &quot;Really, it&#39;s not bad news. &nbsp;Unless you had matrimonial plans concerning Miss Hill.&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c376"><span class="c0">I pretended I knew what she was talking about, most times if you listen to how &nbsp;grown folks ask a question they let you know what it is they want to hear. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c43"><span class="c0">I said, &quot;No, ma&#39;am, I didn&#39;t plan that at all.&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c84"><span class="c0">She laughed again and said, &quot;Good, because I don&#39;t think her new husband &nbsp;would appreciate the competition. Chariemae &hellip;&hellip;&hellip;. Miss Hill is currently &nbsp;living in Chicago, Illinois.&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c18"><span class="c0">I said, &quot;Husband? You mean she got married, ma&#39;am?&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c500"><span class="c0">The librarian said, &quot;Oh, yes, and I must tell you, she was radiating happiness.&quot; &nbsp;I said, &quot;And she moved all the way to Chicago?&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c0">&quot;That&#39;s right, but Chicago isn&#39;t that far. Here, I&rsquo;ll show you.&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c60"><span class="c0">She reached under her desk and pulled out a thick leather book called Atlas of &nbsp;the United States of America. </span></p><p class="c126"><span class="c0">She thumbed through a couple of pages and said, &quot;Here we are.&quot; She turned the &nbsp;book to me, it was a big map of Michigan and a couple of the states that were &nbsp;next to it. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c212"><span class="c0">&quot;We&#39;re here.&quot; She pointed to the spot that said Flint. &quot;And Chicago is here in &nbsp;Illinois.&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c412"><span class="c0">They looked pretty close, but I know how tricky maps can be, shucks, they can &nbsp;put the whole world on one page on a map, so I said, &quot;How long would it take &nbsp;someone to walk that far?&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c117"><span class="c0">She said, &quot;Oh, dear, quite a while, I&#39;m afraid. Let&#39;s check the distance.&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c95"><span class="c0">She reached under the desk and pulled out another thick book called Standard &nbsp;Highway Mileage Guide and turned to a page that had a million numbers and &nbsp;city names on it. She showed me how to find Chicago on the line that was &nbsp;running across the page and Flint on the line that was running down the page &nbsp;and then to look at the number that was writ where the two of them joined up. It &nbsp;said 270. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c318"><span class="c0">She pulled a pencil out and said, &quot;OK, this is how one figures the amount of &nbsp;time required to walk to Chicago. Now--&quot; She pulled a third book out. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c270"><span class="c0">Shucks, this is one of the bad things about talking to librarians, I asked one &nbsp;question and already she had us digging through three different books. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c392"><span class="c0">She thumbed through the book until she said, &quot;Aha, it says here that the &nbsp;average male human gait is five miles an hour. OK, assuming that you could &nbsp;cover five miles an hour, all we have to do is divide two hundred seventy by &nbsp;five.&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c669"><span class="c0">She did it and said, &quot;Fifty-four hours! Much too long to be practical. No, I&#39;m &nbsp;afraid you&#39;ll simply have to wait until Mrs. Rollins comes back to Flint for a &nbsp;visit.&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c372"><span class="c0">Shucks. Chicago might as well be a million miles away from Flint and Miss &nbsp;Hill might as well be a squashed, crunched-up mess in a washing machine &nbsp;when it came down to helping me now. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c277"><span class="c0">I thanked the librarian for the bad news and went to sit at one of the big heavy &nbsp;tables so I could think what to do next. </span></p><p class="c243"><span class="c0">Going back to the Home was out, it used to be that we&#39;d get a new kid every &nbsp;once in a while, but lately it seems like there&#39;s a couple of new kids every day, &nbsp;mostly babies, and they&#39;re most always sick. It&#39;s not like it was when I first got &nbsp;there, shucks, half the folks that run it don&#39;t even tell you their name and don&#39;t &nbsp;remember yours unless you&#39;re in trouble all the time or getting ready to move &nbsp;out. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c504"><span class="c0">After while I got my suitcase and walked into the regular air and stinking &nbsp;smells of Flint. That library door closing after I walked out was the exact kind &nbsp;of door Momma had told me about. I knew that since it had closed the next one &nbsp;was about to open. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c56"><span class="c377">I went back under my tree and before I knew it I was asleep. &nbsp;</span></p><h1 class="c118 c332" id="h.oljdd2jm3n1d"><span class="c5">CHAPTER 8</span></h1><p class="c486"><span class="c0">SOMETHING STEPPED on a little stick. As soon as the twig cracked my eyes &nbsp;snapped open and I was wide awake. I held my breath and kept as still as I &nbsp;could. Whatever it was that was sneaking up on me knew I&#39;d woked up &#39;cause it &nbsp;stopped moving and kept as still as it could too. Even though my head was still &nbsp;under my blanket, I could feel two eyes staring at me real hard, and I knew &nbsp;these weren&#39;t critter eyes, these eyes made the hair on the back of my neck raise &nbsp;up the way only human beings eyes can do. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c487"><span class="c0">Without wiggling or jiggling around too much under my blanket I got my &nbsp;fingers wrapped around my jack- knife. Right when I was ready to push the &nbsp;covers off of me and start running or stabbing, whoever it was that had been &nbsp;watching jumped right on top of me. I was as frapped as a roach under a &nbsp;dishrag! &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c550"><span class="c0">I tried to guess the exact spot that the person&#39;s heart was at, then pulled my &nbsp;knife back. A voice said, &quot;If you ain&#39;t a kid called Bud from the Home I&#39;m &nbsp;really sorry about jumping on you like this !&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c43"><span class="c0">It was Bugs! &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c115"><span class="c0">When I tried to talk it felt like I had to suck all the air out of Flint, I finally got &nbsp;breathing right and said, &quot;Doggone it, Bugs, it is me! You nearly scared me to &nbsp;death!&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c202"><span class="c0">He got off of me and I threw the blanket over to the side. &quot;You don&#39;t know how &nbsp;lucky you are, I was just about fixing to stab you in the heart!&quot; Bugs looked </span></p><p class="c197"><span class="c0">like he knew he&#39;d just had a real close call. He said, &quot;I&#39;m sorry, Bud, I didn&#39;t &nbsp;mean to scare you, but everybody knows how you like to sleep with that knife &nbsp;open so I figured I&#39;d best grab hold of you so&#39;s you wouldn&#39;t wake up slicing &nbsp;nobody.&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c661"><span class="c0">Shucks, even though it was Bugs who&#39;d come real close to getting his heart &nbsp;poked, I was the one who was still having trouble catching my breath. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c244"><span class="c0">I asked, &quot;How come you aren&#39;t back at the Home?&quot; But before he had a chance &nbsp;to answer I knew. &quot;You&#39;re on the lam.&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c548"><span class="c0">Bugs said, &quot;Yup. I&#39;m going back to riding the rails. When I heard about you &nbsp;beating that kid up so bad that you had to take off I figured it was time for me &nbsp;to get going too. I thought you might be hanging around the library so I come &nbsp;down to see if you wanted to go with me.&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c23"><span class="c0">&quot;Where you heading?&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c205"><span class="c0">&quot;There&#39;s always fruits to be picked out west, I heard we can make enough &nbsp;money to get by out there. There&#39;s supposed to be a train leaving sometime &nbsp;tomorrow. Did you really beat that kid up in the foster home?&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c18"><span class="c0">I said, &quot;Uh-huh, we kind of had a fight. How long&#39;s it take to get out west?&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c301"><span class="c0">Bugs said, &quot;Depends on how many trains you got to hop. Was he really two &nbsp;years older than you?&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c57"><span class="c0">&quot;Uh-huh, he was twelve. Is it fun to hop a train?&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c47"><span class="c0">&quot;Some of the time it is, some of the time it&#39;s scary. We heard he was kind of big &nbsp;too, was he?&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c266"><span class="c0">I said, &quot;He was pretty big. I can&#39;t see how we can hop on a train, they look like &nbsp;they&#39;re moving pretty doggone fast.&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c394"><span class="c0">Bugs said, &quot;Most times you don&#39;t hop them when they&#39;re going fast, most times &nbsp;you try to climb on one when it&#39;s sitting in the train yard. Did the guy cry after &nbsp;you whupped him?&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c221"><span class="c0">&quot;Well, kind of, he looked real scared, then told his momma to keep me away &nbsp;from him. They even said I was a hoodlum. Will we be sleeping on the train &nbsp;and everything?&quot; </span></p><p class="c719"><span class="c0">&quot;Sure we will. Some of the time the train don&#39;t stop for two or three days. Man, &nbsp;I always try to tell people that just because someone&#39;s skinny it don&#39;t mean they &nbsp;can&#39;t fight, you&#39;re a hero now, Bud!&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c509"><span class="c0">&quot;Naw, I didn&#39;t really do nothing much. Well, how &#39;bout the toilet? How we &nbsp;going to use the toilet if the train doesn&#39;t stop?&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c43"><span class="c0">Bugs said, &quot;You just kind of lean out of the door and go.&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0">&quot;When the train is still moving?&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0">&quot;Yeah. You get a real nice breeze.&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0">&quot;Oh, man! That sounds great! Count me in, I can&#39;t wait!&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c633"><span class="c0">Bugs spit a big glob of slob in his hand and said, &quot;I knew I could depend on &nbsp;you, Bud.&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c222"><span class="c0">I spit a big glob in my hand and said, &quot;We&#39;re brothers forever, Bugs!&quot; We &nbsp;slapped our hands together as hard as we could and got our slobs mixed up real &nbsp;good, then waved them in the air so they&#39;d dry. Now it was official, I finally &nbsp;had a brother! &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c147"><span class="c0">Bugs said, &quot;We&#39;ll go down to the mission. There&#39;s bound to be someone there &nbsp;that knows about where we can hop this train, then we&#39;ll be on the lam &nbsp;together!&quot; WE FOUND OUT that we&#39;d have to go to a city called Hooperville &nbsp;just outside of Flint. The only trouble was nobody knew exactly where &nbsp;Hooperville was. It was dark before we found out the right direction. I&#39;d never &nbsp;heard of a city that was so doggone hard to find. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c85"><span class="c0">We walked on a trail through some woods that run right up against Thread &nbsp;Crick. We could tell we were getting close to Hooperville &#39;cause we heard &nbsp;somebody playing a mouth organ and the smell of food cooking was getting &nbsp;stronger. We kept walking in the direction that the sky was glowing with a &nbsp;orangeish light. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c14"><span class="c0">When we could hear the music real clear, and folks talking to each other and &nbsp;the sound of sticks cracking in a fire, we started cutting through the trees. That &nbsp;way we could peek into Hooperville first. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c543"><span class="c0">We looked out from behind a big tree and saw that a big wind or even two or &nbsp;three big wolves huffing and puffing real hard could blow Hooperville into the </span></p><p class="c344"><span class="c0">next county. It was a bunch of huts and shacks thrown together out of pieces of &nbsp;boxes and wood and cloth. The Amoses&#39; shed would&#39;ve looked like a real fancy &nbsp;house here. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c300"><span class="c0">Right near our tree was the big fire that had been lighting up the sky. It looked &nbsp;like a hundred people were sitting around it, watching things burn or waiting &nbsp;for the food cooking in three big pots set up in the fire. There were two littler &nbsp;fires burning in Hooperville. One had a pot that was big enough to boil a whole &nbsp;person in it. A man was stirring things in the pot with a big stick and when he &nbsp;raised the stick up he&#39;d pull some britches or a shirt out and pass it over to a &nbsp;white man who was hanging the clothes on a line to dry. There was a mountain &nbsp;of clothes on the ground next to him waiting on their turn. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c114"><span class="c0">The other fire in Hooperville was real small. It was off to the side, by itself. &nbsp;There were five white people sitting at this fire, two kids, a man, and a woman &nbsp;holding a little wrapped-up baby. The baby sounded like all those new sick &nbsp;babies at the Home, it was coughing like it was a half-dead little animal. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c45"><span class="c0">Bugs whispered, &quot;Shoot, this ain&#39;t no city, this is just another cardboard jungle.&quot; &nbsp;&quot;A what?&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c519"><span class="c0">&quot;A cardboard jungle, somewhere you can get off the train and clean up and get &nbsp;something to eat without the cops chasing you out of town.&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c311"><span class="c0">I said, &quot;Well, what&#39;re we going to do? We can&#39;t just go busting into this city and &nbsp;expect someone to feed us, can we?&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c425"><span class="c0">Bugs said, &quot;One of us has got to talk to them, let&#39;s flip for it.&quot; &nbsp;&quot;OK.&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c360"><span class="c0">Bugs rumbled around in his pocket and found a penny. He rubbed it up against &nbsp;his britches and said, &quot;Heads I win, tails you lose.&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c23"><span class="c0">&quot;OK.&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c621"><span class="c0">He flipped the penny up into the air and caught it, then slapped it down on the &nbsp;back of his left hand. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c568"><span class="c0">He peeked underneath his right hand to see and a big smile cracked his face. &nbsp;Shucks! </span></p><p class="c46"><span class="c0">Bugs said. &quot;Tails. You lose.&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0">&quot;Dang! So what should 1 say?&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0">&quot;Ask them if this is Hooperville, see if they got any extra food.&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c21"><span class="c0">I moved out from behind our tree and walked over toward the biggest fire, I &nbsp;waited until some folks noticed me, then said, &quot;Excuse me, is this here &nbsp;Hooperville?&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c273"><span class="c0">The man who was playing the mouth organ stopped and everyone else around &nbsp;the fire looked up at me. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c76"><span class="c0">One of the white men said, &quot;What is it you looking for?&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c69"><span class="c0">I said, &quot;A city called Hooperville, sir.&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c69"><span class="c0">They all laughed. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c334"><span class="c0">The mouth organ man said, &quot;Naw, son, what you&#39;re looking for is Hooverville, &nbsp;with a v, like in President Herbert Hoover.&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c18"><span class="c0">I said, &quot;Oh, is this it, sir?&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c69"><span class="c0">The man said, &quot;This is one of them.&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c69"><span class="c0">I said, &quot;One of them?&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c405"><span class="c0">He answered, &quot;They&#39;re all over the country, this here is the Flint version.&quot; &nbsp;&quot;And all of them are called Hooverville?&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c70"><span class="c0">&quot;That&#39;s right, Mr. Hoover worked so hard at making sure every city has got one &nbsp;that it seems like it would be criminal to call them anything else.&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c55"><span class="c0">Someone said. &quot;That&#39;s the truth!&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c383"><span class="c0">I said. &quot;Well. How&rsquo;re we going to know if we&#39;re in the right one?&#39; &nbsp;The mouth organ man said, &quot;Are you hungry?&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c0">&quot;Yes. sir.&quot; </span></p><p class="c86"><span class="c0">&quot;Are you tired?&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0">&quot;Yes, sir. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0">&quot;Are you scared about what&#39;s going to happen tomorrow?&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c34"><span class="c0">I didn&#39;t want anyone to think I was a baby so I said, &quot;Not exactly scared, sir, &nbsp;maybe I am a little bit nervous.&quot; The man smiled and said, &quot;Well, son, anyplace &nbsp;where there&#39;re other folks in need of the same things that you are is the right &nbsp;place to be. This is exactly the Hooverville you&#39;re looking for.&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c682"><span class="c0">I knew what the man was trying to say. This was the exact same kind of circle talking and cross-talking that Momma used to do. Bugs hadn&#39;t had that kind of &nbsp;practice, he came from behind the tree and said, &quot;I don&#39;t get it, you said there &nbsp;were Hoovervilles all over the place, what if we was looking for the &nbsp;Hooverville in Detroit or Chicago, how could this be the right one to be in?&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c18"><span class="c0">The man said, &quot;You boys from Flint?&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c69"><span class="c0">I said, &quot;Yes, sir.&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c556"><span class="c0">The man waved his mouth organ like a magic wand and pointed it all over the &nbsp;little cardboard city. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c57"><span class="c0">&quot;Boys&rdquo; he said, &quot;look around you.&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c496"><span class="c0">The city was bigger than I thought it was. The raggedy little huts were in every &nbsp;direction you looked. And there were more people sitting around than I first &nbsp;thought too, mostly it was men and big boys, but there were a couple of women &nbsp;every now and then and a kid or two. They were all the colors you could think &nbsp;of, black, white and brown, but the fire made everyone look like they were &nbsp;different shades of orange. There were dark orange folks sitting next to medium &nbsp;orange folks sitting next to light orange folks. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c246"><span class="c0">&quot;All these people&quot; the mouth organ man said, &quot;are just like you, they&#39;re tired, &nbsp;hungry and a little bit nervous about tomorrow. This here is the right place for &nbsp;y&#39;all to be &#39;cause we&#39;re all in the same boat. And you boys are nearer to home &nbsp;than you&#39;ll ever get.&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c55"><span class="c0">Someone said, &quot;Amen, brother&quot; </span></p><p class="c182"><span class="c0">The mouth organ man said, &quot;It don&#39;t matter if you&#39;re looking for Chicago or &nbsp;Detroit or Ortando or Oklahoma City, I rode the rails to all of them. You might &nbsp;think or you might hear that things are better just down the line, but they&#39;re &nbsp;singing the same sad song all over this country. Believe me, son, being on the &nbsp;road is no good. If you two boys are from Flint, this is the right Hooverville for &nbsp;you.&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c700"><span class="c0">Someone said, &quot;Brother, why don&#39;t we feed these boys? That one looks like he &nbsp;ain&#39;t eaten in two or three months.&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c55"><span class="c0">Shucks, he didn&#39;t have to point or nothing, everyone knew who he meant. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">But I didn&#39;t care, the food that was bubbling up in those three big pots even &nbsp;sounded delicious. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c506"><span class="c0">The mouth organ man said, &quot;You&rsquo;re welcome to join us, but we all pitch in &nbsp;here, so&#39;s unless either one of you is carrying one of them smoked West &nbsp;Virginny hams in them bags, it looks like you&#39;ll be pulling KP tonight.&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c43"><span class="c0">I said, &quot;Pulling what, sir?&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c718"><span class="c0">He said, &quot;KP Kitchen Police, you do the cleanup after everyone&#39;s had their fill. &nbsp;There&#39;re a couple of other young folks who&#39;ll show you what you have to do&rdquo; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c0">Me and Bugs both said, &quot;Yes, sir!&quot; This seemed like a real good trade. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c187"><span class="c0">A woman handed me and Bugs each a flat, square, empty tin can. &quot;That, &nbsp;m&#39;lords, is your china. Please be careful not to chip it.&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c263"><span class="c0">My china had the words JUMBO A&amp;P SARDINES stamped into the bottom of &nbsp;it. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c672"><span class="c0">She handed us two beat-up old spoons and said, &quot;Don&#39;t be shy, you two just &nbsp;about missed supper, you&#39;d best hurry up.&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c55"><span class="c0">She took us over to one of the big pots and filled up our tin plates. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c39"><span class="c0">&quot;You&#39;re lucky&rdquo; she said, &quot;it&#39;s muskrat stew and there&#39;s plenty left over tonight, &nbsp;eat as much as you can.&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c535"><span class="c0">The stew was made out of dandelion greens and a couple of potatoes and some &nbsp;small wild carrots and some crawdads and a couple of little chunks of meat. It &nbsp;tasted great! We both even got seconds! </span></p><p class="c625"><span class="c0">When we were done, the woman told us, &quot;You boys leave your bags here, it&#39;s &nbsp;time to do the dishes now.&quot; Uh-oh. &quot;Ma&#39;am, I like to keep my suitcase with me &nbsp;wherever I go.&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c23"><span class="c0">&quot;I promise you your suitcase will be safe here.&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c442"><span class="c0">I remembered the Amoses had promised the same thing. I said, &quot;You&#39;ll watch it &nbsp;yourself, ma&#39;am? You&#39;ll make sure no one looks inside of it?&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c199"><span class="c0">She said, &quot;Son, we don&#39;t have no thieving in here, we all look out for each &nbsp;other.&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c18"><span class="c0">I said, &quot;Thank you, ma&#39;am&quot; and put my suitcase down near the woman&#39;s feet. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c367"><span class="c0">Me, Bugs, a little white boy and a little girl loaded a whole mess of dirty tin &nbsp;cans and spoons and a couple of real plates and forks into a big wooden box &nbsp;and lugged them down to Thread Crick. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c387"><span class="c0">The little girl had been in Hooverville the longest so she got to tell the rest of us &nbsp;what to do. She said, &quot;I don&#39;t suppose neither one of you new boys knows how &nbsp;to do dishes the right way, do you?&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c431"><span class="c0">Me and Bugs had done tons of dishes in the Home so I said, &quot;Sure we do, we &nbsp;used to be real good at cleaning up.&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c370"><span class="c0">Bugs said, &quot;Dang, girl, you act like this is the first cardboard jungle I&#39;ve been &nbsp;in, I know how you do dishes at here.&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c598"><span class="c0">She said, &quot;OK then, we&#39;ll split them up, you and you&quot;--she pointed at Bugs and &nbsp;the other kid--&quot;can do half, and me and this boy can do the others. What&#39;s your &nbsp;name?&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c18"><span class="c0">I said, &quot;Bud, not Buddy.&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c103"><span class="c0">She said, &quot;I&#39;m Deza Malone.&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c602"><span class="c0">Deza handed Bugs and the other little boy some rags and some soap powder &nbsp;and they started splashing the dishes in the water. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c297"><span class="c0">Me and the girl walked a little farther up the crick and started unloading the rest &nbsp;of the dishes. &quot;You dry, I&rsquo;ll wash,&quot; she said. </span></p><p class="c435"><span class="c0">She handed me a rag and just as soon as she&#39;d splashed one of the tin cans in &nbsp;the water and give it to me I&#39;d dry it and stick it in the wooden box. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c55"><span class="c0">She said, &quot;Where you say you was from?&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0">&quot;Flint, right here.&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c298"><span class="c0">&quot;So, you and your friend come down here to get on that train tomorrow?&quot; &nbsp;&quot;Where&#39;s it going?&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c153"><span class="c0">&quot;Chicago&rdquo; she said. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0">&quot;Is that west from here?&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0">&quot;Uh-huh&rdquo; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c558"><span class="c0">&quot;Then yup, that&#39;s where we&#39;re heading&rdquo; I said. &quot;Where you from?&quot; &nbsp;&quot;Lancaster, Pennsylvania.&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c0">&quot;You going to take the train too?&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c721"><span class="c0">She said, &quot;Uh-uh. My daddy is. Folks say there&#39;s work out west so he&#39;s going to &nbsp;try again.&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c57"><span class="c0">&quot;So you&#39;re going to wait here for him?&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0">&quot;Uh-huh.&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c599"><span class="c0">She was real fast at washing the dishes but I noticed she got kind of slow and &nbsp;was touching my hand a lot when it came to giving them to me. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c117"><span class="c0">She said, &quot;Where&#39;s your momma and daddy?&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0">&quot;My mother died four years ago.&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0">&quot;Sorry to hear that.&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0">&quot;It&#39;s OK, she didn&#39;t suffer or nothing.&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0">&quot;So where&#39;s your daddy?&quot; </span></p><p class="c86"><span class="c0">&quot;I think he lives in Grand Rapids, I never met him.&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c610"><span class="c0">&quot;Sorry to hear that.&quot; Shucks, she held right on to my hand when she said that. I &nbsp;squirmed my hand a-loose and said, &quot;That&#39;s OK too.&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c587"><span class="c0">Deza said &quot;No it&#39;s not, and you should quit pretending that it is.&quot; &quot;Who said I&#39;m &nbsp;pretending anything?&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c471"><span class="c0">&quot;I know you are, my daddy says families are the most important thing there is. &nbsp;That&#39;s why me and my momma are going to wait together for him to come back &nbsp;or write for us to come to him.&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c217"><span class="c0">I said, &quot;My mother said the same thing, that families should be there for each &nbsp;other all the time. She always used to tell me that no matter where I went or &nbsp;what I did that she&#39;d be there for me, even if she wasn&#39;t somewhere that I could &nbsp;see her. She told me .. .&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c497"><span class="c0">Shucks, there&#39;re some folks who&#39;ll have you running your mouth before you &nbsp;know what you&#39;re doing. I quit talking and acted like I was having a real hard &nbsp;time drying the tin can she&#39;d just handed me. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c57"><span class="c0">&quot;What&#39;d she tell you, Bud?&#39;&#39; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c87"><span class="c0">I looked at Deza Malone and figured I&#39;d never see her again in my life so I kept &nbsp;shooting off my mouth. &quot;She would tell me every night before I went to sleep &nbsp;that no matter what happened I could sleep knowing that there had never been a &nbsp;little boy, anywhere, anytime, who was loved more than she loved me. She told &nbsp;me that as long as I remembered that I&#39;d be OK.&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c23"><span class="c0">&quot;And you knew it was the truth.&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0">&quot;Just as much as I know my name&#39;s Bud, not Buddy.&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c103"><span class="c0">She said, &quot;Don&#39;t you have no other kin here in Flint?&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0">&quot;No.&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c100"><span class="c0">&quot;I guess I can&#39;t blame you for wanting to ride the rails. My momma says these &nbsp;poor kids on the road all alone are like dust in the wind. But I guess you&#39;re &nbsp;different, aren&#39;t you, Bud? I guess you sort of carry your family around inside &nbsp;of you, huh?&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c23"><span class="c0">&quot;I guess I do. Inside my suitcase, too.&quot; </span></p><p class="c457"><span class="c0">She said, &quot;So you been staying in a orphanage since your momma died?&quot; &nbsp;&quot;What makes you say that?&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c434"><span class="c0">&quot;Well, you&#39;re kind of skinny, but I can tell by the way you talk and the way you &nbsp;act that you haven&#39;t been out on the road for very long. You still look young.&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c203"><span class="c0">I said, &quot;Shucks, I&#39;m not all that young, I&#39;m going to be eleven on November &nbsp;fourteenth, and I&#39;m not skinny, I&#39;m wiry. Some folks think I&#39;m a hero.&quot; &quot;So, Mr. &nbsp;Hero, we&#39;re the same age. But you have been staying in a orphanage.&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c23"><span class="c0">&quot;I been staying in a home.&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c209"><span class="c0">&quot;My daddy says being on the road ain&#39;t fit for a dog, much less a kid, how come &nbsp;you don&#39;t just go back to your orphanage?&quot; She started up touching my hand &nbsp;too much again. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c654"><span class="c0">Deza Malone seemed like she was all right so I came clean with her. &quot;Don&#39;t tell &nbsp;no one, but I lit out from a foster home so I&#39;m on the lam. And I wouldn&#39;t go &nbsp;back to the Home even if I could. It&#39;s getting so&#39;s there&#39;s too many kids in &nbsp;there.&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c166"><span class="c0">&quot;So? That&#39;s better than being cold and hungry all the time and dodging the &nbsp;railroad police.&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c107"><span class="c0">&quot;What do you mean?&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c353"><span class="c0">&quot;You don&#39;t think they just let people jump on the trains, do you?&quot; &nbsp;&quot;Well, I guess I hadn&#39;t thought about it.&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c685"><span class="c0">&quot;See, I knew you were too nice to have been out on the road, you&#39;re going to &nbsp;have a bad surprise tomorrow morning.&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c271"><span class="c0">&quot;That won&#39;t bother me too much.&quot; She said, &quot;Oh, yeah, I forgot, you&#39;re a hero to &nbsp;some folks.&quot; When Deza smiled a little dimple jumped up in her brown cheek. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c43"><span class="c0">I didn&#39;t answer, I just kept drying tin cans. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c287"><span class="c0">We got to the last four or five tin can plates and Deza said, &quot;You ever kiss a girl &nbsp;at the orphanage?&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c0">Uh-oh! &quot;Are you kidding?&quot; </span></p><p class="c86"><span class="c0">&quot;No. Why, you afraid of girls?&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0">&quot;You must be kidding.&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c619"><span class="c0">She said, &quot;OK&rdquo; and closed her eyes and mooshed her lips up and leaned close &nbsp;to me. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c616"><span class="c0">Dangee! If I didn&#39;t kiss her she&#39;d think I was scared of girls, if I did kiss her she &nbsp;might blab or Bugs might see me and tell strangers about what happened. I &nbsp;looked down the crick to where Bugs and the other boy were still splashing in &nbsp;the water. It was dark enough that I didn&#39;t think they could see us too good. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c317"><span class="c0">I scooched my lips up and mashed my face on Deza Malone&#39;s. We stuck like &nbsp;that for a hot second, but it felt like a long time. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c109"><span class="c0">When I opened my eyes and pulled back Deza kept hers closed and smiled. She &nbsp;looked down and stuck her hand in mine again and this time I let her keep it &nbsp;there. She looked out at the crick and the woods on the other side and said, &nbsp;&quot;Isn&#39;t this romantic?&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c664"><span class="c0">I looked out to see what she was talking about. The only thing I could see was &nbsp;the moon like a big egg yolk way up in the sky. You could hear the water and &nbsp;the sound of the mouth organ man playing a sad song back in Hooverville. I &nbsp;sneaked another peek at Deza&#39;s dimple. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c369"><span class="c0">She said, &quot;You hear that? That&#39;s &#39;Shenandoah&#39; he&#39;s playing. Isn&#39;t it pretty?&quot; &nbsp;&quot;I guess so.&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c0">&quot;Do you know the words?&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0">&quot;Uh-uh.&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0">&quot;Listen. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c36"><span class="c5">It&#39;s been seven long years &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c36"><span class="c5">Since last I&#39;ve seen her, &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c36"><span class="c5">Way hey, you rolling river, &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c36"><span class="c5">Been seven long years, </span></p><p class="c119"><span class="c5">Since last I&#39;ve seen her; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c36"><span class="c5">Way hey, I&#39;m bound away, &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c36"><span class="c5">&quot;Cross the wide Miss-oo-ray.&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c69"><span class="c0">I said, &quot;Yup, that&#39;s a sad song.&quot; I didn&#39;t think it was pretty at all. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c22"><span class="c0">She squeezed my hand and said, &quot;Isn&#39;t it? It&#39;s about an Indian man and woman &nbsp;who can&#39;t see each other for seven years. But in all that time they still stay in &nbsp;love, no matter what happens. It reminds me of my mother and father.&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c23"><span class="c0">&quot;Your dad&#39;s been gone for seven years before?&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c192"><span class="c0">She looked out over the crick like the big eggy moan had her hypnotized. I &nbsp;pulled my hand from hers and said, &quot;Well, that&#39;s just about it for the dishes.&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c55"><span class="c0">She smiled again. &quot;Bud, I&rsquo;ll never forget this night.&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c427"><span class="c0">I didn&#39;t tell her, but I probably wouldn&#39;t forget it either, I&#39;d practiced on the &nbsp;back of my hand before, but this was the first time I&#39;d ever busted slob with a &nbsp;real live girl. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c174"><span class="c0">We loaded all the dishes in the box and walked down to Bugs and the other kid. &nbsp;We put their dishes on top of ours and headed back. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c484"><span class="c0">Bugs said, &quot;How come you&#39;re looking so strange, Bud? You look like you been &nbsp;chunked in the head with a rock.&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c449"><span class="c0">Deza Malone laughed, and for a second I thought she was going to rat me out. &nbsp;I said, &quot;I don&#39;t know, I guess that song is making me kind of sad.&quot; &nbsp;Bugs said, &quot;Yeah, it is kind of sad.&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c368"><span class="c0">Right before we got into the cardboard jungle we passed the white people with &nbsp;the coughing baby at their own little fire. I said to Deza, &quot;How come they&#39;re off &nbsp;alone, they aren&#39;t allowed to sit around the big fire &#39;cause that baby&#39;s making so &nbsp;much noise?&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c527"><span class="c0">Deza said, &quot;Uh-uh, they been invited, but my daddy said you got to feel sorry &nbsp;for them. All they&#39;re eating is dandelion greens soup, they&#39;re broke, their &nbsp;clothes are falling off of them, their baby&#39;s sick but when someone took them </span></p><p class="c632"><span class="c0">some food and blankets, the man said, &#39;Thank you very much, but we&#39;re white &nbsp;people. We ain&#39;t in need of a handout.&#39; &quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c715"><span class="c0">When we got back to the main fire of Hooverville we put the dishes in another &nbsp;box. Deza made us turn them all upside down so&#39;s if the rain got into them they &nbsp;wouldn&#39;t rust. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c473"><span class="c0">I went to the woman with my suitcase. It was in the same spot I&#39;d left it and the &nbsp;knots in the twine were the kind I tie. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c533"><span class="c0">I said, &quot;Thank you very much, ma&#39;am.&quot; She said, &quot;I told you not to worry.&quot; &nbsp;I went back to the big fire to sit with Bugs. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c699"><span class="c0">The mouth organ man said, &quot;I suppose you boys are going out on that train &nbsp;tomorrow?&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c43"><span class="c0">I said, &quot;The one for Chicago, sir?&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c69"><span class="c0">He said, &quot;That&#39;s the one.&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c69"><span class="c0">I said, &quot;Yes, we are, sir.&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c272"><span class="c0">He said, &quot;Well, you&#39;d best get as much sleep as you can. It&#39;s supposed to be &nbsp;pulling out at five-fifteen, but you never know with these freights.&quot; We got in &nbsp;one of the shacks with some other boys. Bugs was snoring in two seconds, but I &nbsp;couldn&#39;t sleep, I opened my jackknife and put it under my blanket. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c691"><span class="c0">I was thinking. Deza&#39;s momma was right, someone who doesn&#39;t know who their &nbsp;family is, is like dust blowing around in a storm, they don&#39;t really belong any &nbsp;one place. I started wondering if going to California was the right thing to do. I &nbsp;might not know who my family was, but I knew they were out there &nbsp;somewhere, and it seemed to make a whole lot more sense to think that they &nbsp;were somewhere around Flint instead of out west. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c491"><span class="c0">I opened my suitcase to get my blanket. Even though I trusted the woman &nbsp;who&#39;d guarded it for me I checked to make sure everything was OK. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c730"><span class="c0">I picked up the tobacco pouch that had my rocks in it and pulled the drawstring &nbsp;open. I shook the five smooth stones out and looked at them. They&#39;d been in the &nbsp;drawer after the ambulance took Momma away and I&#39;d had them ever since. </span></p><p class="c167"><span class="c0">Someone had took a pen or something and had writ on all five of them, but it &nbsp;was writ in a code so I couldn&#39;t understand what they meant. One of them said &nbsp;&quot;kent land in. 5.10.11.&quot; Another said &quot;loogootee in. 5.16.11&rdquo; then there was &nbsp;&quot;sturgis in. 8.30.12&quot; and &quot;gary in. 6.13.12&quot; and the last one said, &quot;flint in. &nbsp;8.11.11.&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c268"><span class="c0">I put them back in their pouch and pulled the string tight. Then I pulled out the &nbsp;envelope that had the picture of the saggy pony at the Miss B. Gotten Moon &nbsp;Park. It was fine. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c541"><span class="c0">Next I counted the flyers again, all five were there, I slid all of them back, &nbsp;except for the blue one. I held it up so it could catch some of the light from the &nbsp;big fire. I kept looking at the picture and wondering why this one bothered &nbsp;Momma so much. The more I thought about it the more I knew this man just &nbsp;had to be my father. Why else would Momma keep these? &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c366"><span class="c0">I used a little trick to help me fall off to sleep. I pulled my blanket right up over &nbsp;my head and breathed in the smell real deep. After doing this three times the &nbsp;smells of the shack and Hooverville were gone and only the smell of the &nbsp;blanket was in my nose. And that smell always reminded me of Momma and &nbsp;how she used to read me to sleep every night. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c539"><span class="c0">I took two more breaths and pretended I was hearing Momma reading to me &nbsp;about the Billy Goats Gruff or the Fox and the Grapes or the Dog That Saw His &nbsp;Reflection in the Water or some other story she&#39;d checked out of the library. I &nbsp;could hear Momma&#39;s voice getting farther and farther away as I imagined I was &nbsp;in the story until finally her voice and the story all mixed into one. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c502"><span class="c0">I&#39;d learned that it was best to be asleep before Momma finished the story &nbsp;because if she got done and I was still awake she&#39;d always tell me what the &nbsp;story was about. I never told Momma, but that always mint the fun of the story. &nbsp;Shucks, here I was thinking I was just hearing something funny about a fox or a &nbsp;dog and Momma spoilt it by telling me they were really lessons about not being &nbsp;greedy or not wishing for things you couldn&#39;t have. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c172"><span class="c0">I took two more breaths and started thinking about the little hen that baked the &nbsp;bread. I heard, &quot;Not I,&quot; said the pig. &quot;Not I&rdquo; said the goat. &quot;Not I&rdquo; said the big &nbsp;bad wolf&rdquo; then ... woop, zoop, sloop... I was asleep. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c406"><span class="c0">I started dreaming about the man with the giant fiddle. He was walking away &nbsp;and I kept calling him but he couldn&#39;t look back. Then the dream got a lot </span></p><p class="c241"><span class="c0">better, I turned away from where Herman E. Calloway was and there stood &nbsp;Deza Malone. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c378"><span class="c0">I told her, &quot;I really like your dimple.&quot; She laughed and said, &quot;See you in seven &nbsp;years.&quot; A MAN SCREAMED, &quot;Get UP, they&#39;re trying to sneak it out early!&quot; I &nbsp;jumped straight up and banged my head on the top of the shack. I ran outside. It &nbsp;was still dark and the fire was just a pile of glowing sticks. The man was &nbsp;screaming at the top of his lungs. &quot;Get up! They&#39;ve fired the engine and are &nbsp;fixing to take off!&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c121"><span class="c0">Bugs and the other boys came and stood next to me. Bugs said, &quot;Is it a raid?&quot; &nbsp;Someone said, &quot;No, they&#39;re trying to sneak out before we get up!&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c490"><span class="c0">People started running all over Hooverville. Bugs said &quot;Come on, Bud, get your &nbsp;stuff, we got to get on that train!&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c645"><span class="c0">I folded my blanket up and put it in my suitcase and tied the twine back. I put &nbsp;my jackknife in my pocket and Bugs and I ran outside. I hadn&#39;t got six giant &nbsp;steps away when a boy stuck his head out the door and yelled, &quot;Hey, Slim, is &nbsp;this your paper?&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c693"><span class="c0">I looked back. My blue flyer! I forgot to put it back in the suitcase! &nbsp;Bugs said, &quot;Hurry, I&rsquo;ll wait.&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c0">&quot;I&rsquo;ll catch you, go ahead.&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c706"><span class="c0">I ran back and took my flyer from the boy. &quot;Thanks a lot!&quot; I ran back out into &nbsp;the crowd that was tearing through the woods. There were a million men and &nbsp;boys running in the same direction. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c283"><span class="c0">I didn&#39;t want to fold the flyer up so as I was running I slid it between the twine &nbsp;and the suitcase, I&#39;d put it back inside once we got on the train. No one was &nbsp;talking. All you could hear were the sounds of a million feet smacking on the &nbsp;trail and the sound of a million people trying to catch their breath. Finally a hiss &nbsp;sound started getting louder and louder and I knew we weren&#39;t too far away. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c308"><span class="c0">We broke out of the woods and there in the dark sat the train. The locomotive &nbsp;was hissing and spitting coal-black smoke into the sky, every once in a while a &nbsp;big shower of sparks would glow up from inside the dark cloud, making it look &nbsp;like a gigantic black genie was trying to raise up out of the smokestack. The </span></p><p class="c524"><span class="c0">train went as far back as you could see, there must&#39;ve been a thousand boxcars, &nbsp;but everyone had stopped and was just standing there watching. No one was &nbsp;trying to get on. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c536"><span class="c0">I pushed my way to the front to see if I could find Bugs and I saw why &nbsp;everyone had stopped. There were four cop cars and eight cops standing &nbsp;between the crowd and the train. The cops all had billy clubs and were spread &nbsp;out to protect the train. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c18"><span class="c0">The crowd kept getting bigger and bigger. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c198"><span class="c0">One of the cops yelled, &quot;You men know you can&#39;t get on this train, just go on &nbsp;back to Shantytown and there won&#39;t be no trouble.&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c269"><span class="c0">A white man said, &quot;This is the only train going west for the next month, you &nbsp;know we got families to feed and have got to be on it. You go get back in your &nbsp;cars and you&#39;ll be right, there won&#39;t be no trouble.&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c252"><span class="c0">The cop said, &quot;I&#39;m warning you, the Flint police are on the way, this here is &nbsp;private property and they have orders to shoot anyone who tries to get on this &nbsp;train.&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c185"><span class="c0">A man next to me said, &quot;I&#39;d rather be shot than sit around and watch my kids go &nbsp;hungry.&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c253"><span class="c0">The cop said, &quot;This is America, boys, you&#39;re sounding like a bunch of &nbsp;Commies, you know I can&#39;t let you on this train. I got kids to feed too, and I&#39;d &nbsp;lose my job.&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c288"><span class="c0">Someone yelled, &quot;Well, welcome to the club, brother.&quot; It seemed like we stood &nbsp;looking at the cops and them looking at us for a whole hour. Our side was &nbsp;getting bigger and bigger and the other cops started looking nervous. The one &nbsp;who was doing all the talking saw them fidgeting and said, &quot;Hold steady, men.&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c553"><span class="c0">One of the cops said, &quot;Jake, there&#39;s four hundred men out there and more &nbsp;coming, I don&#39;t like these odds. Mr. Pinkerton ain&#39;t paying me enough to do &nbsp;this.&quot; He threw his cop hat and his billy club on the ground. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c445"><span class="c0">Everybody froze when the train whistle blew one long time and the engine &nbsp;started saying shuh-shuh-shuh. The big steel wheels creaked a couple of times, &nbsp;then started moving. </span></p><p class="c608"><span class="c0">Four of the other cops threw their hats and billy clubs down too. The boss cop &nbsp;said, &quot;You lily-livered rats,&quot; and it was like someone said, &quot;On your mark, get &nbsp;set, go!&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c604"><span class="c0">The engine was saying SHUHSHUHSHUHSHUH- SHUH -- and a million &nbsp;boys and men broke for the brain. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c333"><span class="c0">I got pushed from behind and fell on top of my suitcase. Someone reached &nbsp;down and pulled me up. I squeezed my bag to my stomach and ran. The train &nbsp;was going faster and faster. People were jumping on and reaching back to help &nbsp;others. I finally got to the tracks and was running as hard as I could. I looked up &nbsp;into the boxcar and saw Bugs. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c18"><span class="c0">He screamed, &quot;Bud, throw your bag, throw me your bag!&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c596"><span class="c0">I used both hands to throw my suitcase at the train. Bugs caught it and when he &nbsp;set it behind him the blue flyer blew out of the twine and fluttered outside the &nbsp;door. But it was like a miracle, the flyer flipped over three times and landed &nbsp;right in my hand. 1 slowed down and put it in my pocket. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c18"><span class="c0">Bugs reached one arm out and screamed, &quot;Bud, don&#39;t stop! Run!&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c148"><span class="c0">I started running again but it felt like my legs were gone. The car with Bugs in &nbsp;it was getting farther and farther away. Finally I stopped. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c155"><span class="c0">Bugs was leaning out of the door and stopped reaching back for me. He waved &nbsp;and disappeared into the boxcar. A second later my suitcase came flying out of &nbsp;the door. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c384"><span class="c0">I walked over to where it landed and picked it up. Man, this is one tough &nbsp;suitcase, you couldn&#39;t even tell what it had been through, it still looked exactly &nbsp;the same. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c18"><span class="c0">I sat on the side of the tracks and tried to catch my breath. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c416"><span class="c0">The train and my new pretend brother got farther and farther away, chugging to &nbsp;Chicago. Man, I&#39;d found some family and he was gone before we could really &nbsp;get to know each other. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c626"><span class="c0">There were six or seven other people who didn&#39;t make the train, so we all &nbsp;walked back toward Hooverville. They must&#39;ve lit the big fire again, the sky in &nbsp;that direction was glowing orange. </span></p><p class="c327"><span class="c0">The cop that first threw down his billy club walked over to us and said, &quot;He &nbsp;wasn&#39;t lying about the Flint police coming, but they&#39;re coming to bust up the &nbsp;shanty-town, you all should get out of here.&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c134"><span class="c0">When we got close to Hooverville we heard four gun-shots. We all spread into &nbsp;the woods and sneaked up to see what had happened. I peeked from behind a &nbsp;tree and could see a bunch of cops standing around with pistols out. All the &nbsp;men and boys and women that were left in Hooverville were bunched up on &nbsp;one side and the cops were on the other. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c432"><span class="c0">The fire had been lit and was burning bigger than ever, but now it was burning &nbsp;because the cops were tearing all of the shacks down and were throwing the &nbsp;wood and cardboard and hunks of cloth into the middle of it. One of the cops &nbsp;dragged the big clothes-washing pot over to the side and stuck his pistol down &nbsp;in it and shot four more times. Whew, instead of shooting people they were &nbsp;shooting holes into all of the pots and pans. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c162"><span class="c0">A man was yelling, &quot;You yellow-belly lowlifes, you waited till you knew most &nbsp;of the men was gone, you cowards!&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c399"><span class="c0">The cops wouldn&#39;t talk or nothing, they just kept piling Flint&#39;s Hooverville into &nbsp;the fire. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c18"><span class="c0">I tried to see if I could spot Deza Malone but there were too many people. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c307"><span class="c0">It seemed like the only good thing that came out of going to Hooverville was &nbsp;that I finally kissed a girl. Maybe someone was trying to tell me Something, &nbsp;what with me missing the train and the blue flyer floating back to me, maybe &nbsp;Deza Malone was right. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c0">Maybe I should stay here in Flint. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c278"><span class="c0">I walked back farther into the woods and sat down. I pulled the blue flyer out of &nbsp;my pocket and opened my suitcase back up. I smoothed the flyer out and took &nbsp;another good look at it. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c481"><span class="c0">Maybe it came floating right back to me because this Herman E. Calloway &nbsp;really was my father. Wait a minute! I sat up. The names Caldwell and &nbsp;Calloway are a lot alike, both of them have eight letters and there aren&#39;t too &nbsp;many names that have a C, a A, a L, and a W all together like that. I &nbsp;remembered what I read in that Little-Big Book, Gangbusters. It said a good </span></p><p class="c90"><span class="c0">criminal chooses a alias that&#39;s kind of close to their own name. Except I &nbsp;couldn&#39;t figure out who was a criminal here and why anybody needed a alias. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c188"><span class="c0">I wanted to stay and look for Deza and her mother but it was too hard to hear &nbsp;all the people crying and arguing. Besides. I was still on the lam. I started &nbsp;walking. If I hurried I could get breakfast at the mission. &nbsp;</span></p><h1 class="c179 c118" id="h.jvkjt8ik9q9x"><span class="c5">CHAPTER 9 &nbsp;</span></h1><p class="c49"><span class="c0">I GOT TO THE FOOD line in plenty of time, but my pretend family wasn&#39;t &nbsp;anywhere around. I had to eat by myself, without the brown sugar. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c611"><span class="c0">After I was through I went back to the library and sat under my tree to wait for &nbsp;it to open. I couldn&#39;t stop thinking about Deza Malone and her dimple. How &nbsp;could her father find them now? &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c59"><span class="c0">Finally I saw people going into the library. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c546"><span class="c0">The same librarian was there again. I said, &quot;Good morning, ma&#39; am.&quot; &nbsp;&quot;Good morning, young man. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c322"><span class="c0">&quot;Could I please borrow a pencil and a piece of paper and see that book about &nbsp;how far one city is from another again, ma&#39;am?&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c284"><span class="c0">She said, &quot;Of course you may. You know, after I went home last night I finally &nbsp;recognized you. Didn&#39;t you and your mother used to come in here a long time &nbsp;ago?&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c23"><span class="c0">&quot;Yes, ma&#39;am&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c688"><span class="c0">She said, &quot;And if I remember correctly you and your mother had quite different &nbsp;tastes in books. I remember your mother used to like mysteries and fairy tales, &nbsp;isn&#39;t that so?&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c59"><span class="c0">Man, I can&#39;t believe she remembered that! &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c340"><span class="c0">&quot;And you&#39;re the little fellow who used to come in all the time and ask Miss Hill &nbsp;for books about the Civil War, aren&#39;t you?&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c23"><span class="c0">&quot;Yes, ma&#39;am.&quot; </span></p><p class="c236"><span class="c0">She said, &quot;I thought so!&quot; She handed me the pencil and paper and the cities &nbsp;book, then said, &quot;And when you&#39;re done with the book bring it back and I have &nbsp;something special for you!&quot; She had a huge smile on her face. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c577"><span class="c0">I said, &quot;Thank you, ma&#39;am&quot; but I didn&#39;t get too excited &#39;cause I know the kind of &nbsp;things librarians think are special. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c464"><span class="c0">I went over to a table and found Flint and Grand Rapids in the lines of the &nbsp;book. I looked where the two lines met and it said 120. Wow! That was going &nbsp;to be a good little walk. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c650"><span class="c0">Next I wrote down 120. Then divided it by 5, that came up to 24. That meant &nbsp;I&rsquo;d have to walk for twenty four hours to reach Grand Rapids, one whole day &nbsp;and one whole night. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c258"><span class="c0">I figured it would be easiest to do the night part first so I decided to stick &nbsp;around the library until it got dark, then head for Grand Rapids. I wrote down &nbsp;all the names of all the cities I&#39;d have to pass through to get there, Owosso, &nbsp;Ovid, St. John&#39;s, Ionia and Lowell, and put the paper in my pocket. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c295"><span class="c0">When I took the cities book back the librarian was still smiling. She said, &quot;I&rsquo;ll &nbsp;bet you&#39;ve been dying to know what your surprise is, haven&#39;t you?&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c57"><span class="c0">&quot; I lied. &quot;Yes, ma&#39;am.&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c402"><span class="c0">She reached under her desk and pulled out a thick, thick book called The &nbsp;Pictorial History of the War Between the States. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c622"><span class="c0">Wow! The book was gigantic! &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0">&quot;Thank you very much, ma&#39;am!&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c103"><span class="c0">She said, &quot;Enjoy, enjoy, enjoy!&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c63"><span class="c0">I took the book back to my table. I didn&#39;t want to tell her that I wasn&#39;t really &nbsp;interested in history, it was just that the best gory pictures in the world came &nbsp;from the Civil War. And this book was full of them. It really was a great book. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c382"><span class="c0">There&#39;s another thing that&#39;s strange about the library, it seems like time flies &nbsp;when you&#39;re in one. One second I was opening the first page of the book, &nbsp;hearing the cracking sound the pages make. smelling all the page powder, and &nbsp;reading what battle the picture on that page was from, and the next second the </span></p><p class="c183"><span class="c0">librarian was standing over me saying, &quot;I am very impressed, you really &nbsp;devoured that book, didn&#39;t you? But it&#39;s time to close now. You may start up &nbsp;again first thing tomorrow!&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c305"><span class="c0">I couldn&#39;t believe it, it&#39;d happened again! I&#39;d spent the whole day reading. Her &nbsp;words snapped a spell that was on me, and my stomach started growling right &nbsp;away. I was going to be too late for the mission. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c594"><span class="c0">When she was walking me to the door the librarian stopped at her desk and &nbsp;said, &quot;Now I know that knowledge is a food, but I couldn&#39;t help noticing you &nbsp;never went to eat. You must be very hungry.&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c55"><span class="c0">She handed me a paper bag and gave me another smile. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0">&quot;Thank you, ma&#39;am!&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c103"><span class="c0">She smiled. &quot;See you tomorrow.&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c69"><span class="c0">I said, &quot;Yes, ma&#39;am. Thank you for everything.&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c570"><span class="c0">I went back under the Christmas tree and got my suitcase. By this time &nbsp;tomorrow I&rsquo;d be looking at the face of the man who had to be my father. I &nbsp;started eating the cheese sandwich the librarian gave me. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c629"><span class="c0">And then I headed out for Grand Rapids. IT&#39;S FUNNY HOW IDEAS ARE, in &nbsp;a lot of ways they&#39;re just like seeds. Both of them start real, real small and then &nbsp;... woop, zoop sloop ... before you can say Jack Robinson they&#39;ve gone and &nbsp;grown a lot bigger than you ever thought they could. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c186"><span class="c0">If you look at a great big maple tree it&#39;s hard to believe it started out as a little &nbsp;seed. I mean if you pick up one of those maple tree seeds and turn it over a &nbsp;couple of times in your hand there&#39;s no way your brain will buy that this little &nbsp;thing can grow up into something so big you have to bend your neck back just &nbsp;to see the top of it. Something so big that you can hang a swing on it, or build a &nbsp;tree house in it, or drive a car into it and kill yourself and any bad-lucked &nbsp;passengers that might be taking a ride with you. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c640"><span class="c0">Ideas are a lot like that, that&#39;s what the idea of Herman E. Calloway being my &nbsp;father started as, something so teeny that if I hadn&#39;t paid it no mind it would&#39;ve &nbsp;blown away with the first good puff of wind. But now here it was so big and &nbsp;important and spread out. </span></p><p class="c515"><span class="c0">The idea first got started when I was looking in my suitcase at one of the flyers &nbsp;showing Herman E. Calloway and his band. That was like the seed falling out &nbsp;of a tree and getting planted. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c161"><span class="c0">It started busting its head out of the dirt when me and the other boys at the &nbsp;Home were getting our nightly teasing from the biggest bully there, Billy &nbsp;Burns. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c233"><span class="c0">He&#39;d said, &quot;I don&#39;t even belong in this place. I been put here by mistake and it &nbsp;ain&#39;t going to be long before my momma comes and gets me out.&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c597"><span class="c0">Bugs said, &quot;Billy. how come it&#39;s taking your momma so long to find out where &nbsp;you&#39;re at? She must have a real bad memory. Seems like since she was the one &nbsp;what dropped you off here she&#39;d&#39;ve remembered where she left you by now.&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c559"><span class="c0">Billy said, &quot;Well, well, well, will you take a look at who piped up, Mr. Bugs. &nbsp;You know, I&#39;ve seen lots of people who have roach-infected houses, but you&#39;re &nbsp;the first person I&#39;ve seen who&#39;s got a roach-infected head. I wouldn&#39;t expect a &nbsp;little ignorant roach-head like you to know nothing about folks coming back &nbsp;here to get you out, you don&#39;t even have no idea who your momma and daddy &nbsp;is. Any fool you see walking down the street could be them.&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c191"><span class="c0">He looked at the rest of us and said, &quot;Seven little boys in this room and not a &nbsp;one of y&#39;all knows who your folks is. This is a sure-enough sad collection of &nbsp;souls here, &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c159"><span class="c0">I said, &quot;That&#39;s not true, I know who my momma is, I lived with her for six &nbsp;years.&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c0">Another boy said, &quot;Me too, I lived with my momma for a long time.&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c280"><span class="c0">Billy Burns said to me, &quot;Is that right? And what about your old man? How &nbsp;many years you live with him? I got a nickel here and you know what it says?&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c375"><span class="c0">Billy&#39;d stole a nickel from somewhere and held it up so&#39;s the buffalo on it was &nbsp;looking out at us. He pretended the buffalo was talking, it had a deep voice like &nbsp;you&#39;d figure a buffalo would. It said, &quot;Billy, my man, go ahead and bet this &nbsp;little no-momma fool that he don&#39;t know who his daddy is, then I&#39;d have &nbsp;another nickel to bang around in your pocket with&rdquo; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c572"><span class="c0">Even before I had a chance to think I said, &quot;You owe me a nickel, my daddy &nbsp;plays a giant fiddle and his name is Herman E. Calloway.&quot; </span></p><p class="c163"><span class="c0">And with those words that I didn&#39;t even mean to say that little seed of a idea &nbsp;started growing. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c692"><span class="c0">The idea got bigger and stronger when I&#39;d sit up at night and wonder why &nbsp;Momma&#39;d kept those flyers. It dug its roots in deep and started spreading out &nbsp;when I got old enough to understand that Momma must&#39;ve known she wasn&#39;t &nbsp;going to be around too long and was trying to leave me a message about who &nbsp;my daddy was and why she couldn&#39;t never talk about him. I knew Momma &nbsp;must be too embarrassed about why he wasn&#39;t with us and was trying to break it &nbsp;to me gentle. The only trouble was she waited too long. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c670"><span class="c0">I mean what other reason could there be for Momma to keep all these things I &nbsp;have in my suitcase and treat them like they were treasures, and why did I &nbsp;know way down in my guts that they were real, real important, so important &nbsp;that I didn&#39;t feel comfortable unless I knew where they were all the time? &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c662"><span class="c0">That little idea had gone and sneaked itself into being a mighty maple, tall &nbsp;enough that if I looked up at the top of it I&#39;d get a crick in my neck, big enough &nbsp;for me to hang a climbing rope in, strong enough that I made up my mind to &nbsp;walk clean across the state of Michigan. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c508"><span class="c0">I opened my suitcase and pulled the flyers out before it got dark. I put the blue &nbsp;one with the writing about Flint on it on the bottom and looked at the others. &nbsp;Two of them had the same picture of Herman E. Calloway and the two guys but &nbsp;the first was called &quot;Herman E. Calloway and the Terminally Unhappy Blues &nbsp;Band&quot; they were called &quot;Masters of the Delta Blues&quot; and the other one was &nbsp;called &quot;Herman E. Calloway and the Gifted Gents of Gospel--Featuring Miss &nbsp;Grace &quot;Blessed&#39; Thomas&#39;s Vocals&quot; they were the &quot;Servants of the Master&#39;s &nbsp;Salvation.&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c289"><span class="c0">The two other flyers just had little drawings. The first one was a drawing of a &nbsp;accordion and told about a band named &quot;H. E. Callowski and the Wonderful &nbsp;Warblers of Warsaw&quot; who were the &quot;Masters of the Polka.&quot; The second one &nbsp;was of a picture of some mountains and it told about a band named &quot;H. E. &nbsp;Bonnegut and the Boisterous Big Band of Berlin&quot; who were the &quot;Masters of All &nbsp;We Behold.&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c623"><span class="c0">I put the flyers back in the suitcase and stood up. Just like Bugs, I was going &nbsp;west! &nbsp;</span></p><h1 class="c179 c118 c635" id="h.m0fbbdtejkmg"><span class="c5">&nbsp;</span></h1><h1 class="c119 c118" id="h.2w5lazclki69"><span class="c5">CHAPTER 10 &nbsp;</span></h1><p class="c567"><span class="c0">FLINT ENDED all of a sudden and I was in the country. It was like one of &nbsp;those days that it&#39;s raining on one side of the street and not on the other. Here &nbsp;you have Flint and a sidewalk, you take one baby step, and here you have &nbsp;country and a dirt path. On the sidewalk side a sign said, YOU ARE NOW &nbsp;LEAVING FLINT, HURRY BACK, and on the dirt path side, YOU ARE &nbsp;NOW ENTERING FLINT -- ENJOY YOUR STAY. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c505"><span class="c0">I jumped in and out of Flint around seven times before that got boring and I &nbsp;decided I&#39;d better head for Grand Rapids. It was already very, very dark and &nbsp;unless things were different in the country it wasn&#39;t going to be getting light &nbsp;anytime soon. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c454"><span class="c0">One hundred and twenty miles. It didn&#39;t take too much time before I figured out &nbsp;that twenty-four hours&#39; worth of walking was a lot longer than I thought it &nbsp;would be. I must&#39;ve only been walking for a couple of minutes when everything &nbsp;changed. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c189"><span class="c0">First off there were the sounds. Flint could be pretty noisy, what with cars &nbsp;honking horns and trucks with no mufflers on them shifting gears and people &nbsp;yelling out at each other so you couldn&#39;t tell if they were happy or about to bust &nbsp;out fighting. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c141"><span class="c0">Out here in the country the sounds were loud too, but what I was hearing was &nbsp;the sound of bugs and toady-frogs and mice and rats playing a dangerous, scary &nbsp;kind of hide-and-go-seek where they rustle around and try to keep away from &nbsp;each other or try to find each other. Instead of being tagged and called &quot;it&quot; like &nbsp;the way human beings play the game, out here the ones that got got, got ate up. &nbsp;Every step I took toward Grand Rapids I could hear the sounds of mouse bones &nbsp;and bug skeletons being busted up by the teeth of bigger things. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c219"><span class="c0">Every once in a while a couple of cats would give out the kind of howls and &nbsp;yowls that would make the hair on your neck jump up if you were a human &nbsp;being and your heart turn into a little cup of shaky yellow custard if you were a &nbsp;mouse. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c677"><span class="c0">I walked and walked and walked. Some of the time a car would come by and &nbsp;I&#39;d have to duck into the bushes and wait till it had passed, so I don&#39;t think I was &nbsp;doing any five miles a hour. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c122"><span class="c0">I felt like I&#39;d been walking all night but I&#39;d only gone through three little towns. </span></p><p class="c483"><span class="c0">I was getting so tired that I started to forget to duck in the bushes when a car &nbsp;would roar by. Some of the time they&#39;d see me and step on their brakes for a &nbsp;second, then speed off. Most times they never noticed me. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c64"><span class="c0">Another car bounced over the top of a hill. The lights blinded me for a second &nbsp;and then I ducked into the bushes again. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c430"><span class="c0">The guy in the car stepped on the brakes to slow down and I could see him &nbsp;twist his neck around. He stuck the car in reverse and pulled to a stop about &nbsp;thirty giant steps away from where I was hiding. His door opened and he &nbsp;stepped out and started walking slow toward my bushes. He brushed his hand &nbsp;over his head and put on a black hat like the kind the police or some army men &nbsp;wear. But all the cops I&#39;d ever seen were white so I knew this guy must be a &nbsp;soldier. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c325"><span class="c0">He stopped and put his fingers to his lips and whistled. The whistle was so loud &nbsp;that it made me duck down and put my hands over my ears, it felt like he&#39;d &nbsp;blown it right inside my head. All the bugs and toady- frogs shut right up, they &nbsp;quit chasing and biting each other &#39;cause this had to be the loudest whistle &nbsp;they&#39;d ever heard too. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c62"><span class="c0">Rocks were crunching as the man in the black hat walked a couple of steps up &nbsp;the road, then stopped again. For the second time he blasted my ears with that &nbsp;whistle. The noise-making critters in that patch of road got quiet. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c18"><span class="c0">He said, &quot;Say hey!&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c181"><span class="c0">He waited, then yelled, &quot;Say hey! I know my eyes aren&#39;t what they used to be, &nbsp;but I know they aren&#39;t so bad that they&#39;d lie to me about seeing a young brown skinned boy walking along the road just outside of Owosso, Michigan, at two thirty in the morning.&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c641"><span class="c0">I couldn&#39;t tell if he was talking to me or to himself. I peeked up to see if I could &nbsp;get a better look at this man. He came closer to me, then stopped about ten &nbsp;giant steps away. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c82"><span class="c0">&quot;And I&#39;ll tell you, I&#39;ve seen some things out of place before and a young brown skinned boy walking along the road just outside of Owosso, Michigan, at two thirty in the morning is definitely not where he ought to be. In fact, what is &nbsp;definite is that neither one of us should be out here this time of night.&quot; </span></p><p class="c193"><span class="c0">He squatted down and said, &quot;Are you still there?&quot; I raised my head a little &nbsp;higher to get a better look at him and his big car. He&#39;d left the door open and I &nbsp;could hear the engine of the car grumbling, it was saying, </span><span class="c29">wugga, wugga, &nbsp;wugga, wugga, wugga. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c346"><span class="c0">&quot;Son,&quot; he said, &quot;this is no time to play. I don&#39;t know and I don&#39;t care why you&#39;re &nbsp;out here, but let me tell you I know you&#39;re a long way from home. Are you &nbsp;from Flint?&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c24"><span class="c0">How could he tell I was from Flint just by seeing my face for a second in his &nbsp;headlights? I wonder how grown folks know so doggone much just by looking &nbsp;at you. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c117"><span class="c0">Something was telling me to answer him but I still wanted to get a better look. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c424"><span class="c0">He stood up. &quot;You know what? I bet if I can&#39;t get you to come out with talk I &nbsp;got something else that might make you show your face. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c315"><span class="c0">&quot;From the quick look I got at you, you seemed a little on the puny side. I&rsquo;ll bet &nbsp;anything you&#39;re hungry. Just so happens that I&#39;ve got a spare baloney and &nbsp;mustard sandwich and an apple in the car. You interested?&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c117"><span class="c0">Shucks. How did he know I was so hungry? &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c69"><span class="c0">Then he said, &quot;Might even have some extra red pop.&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c468"><span class="c0">Before my brain could stop it my stomach made my mouth yell out, &quot;But I &nbsp;don&#39;t like mustard, sir.&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c330"><span class="c0">The man could tell which bushes I was hiding in but please open key on me, he &nbsp;didn&#39;t bum-rush them or try to get me, he just laughed and said, &quot;Well, I didn&#39;t &nbsp;check, but I don&#39;t suppose the mustard&#39;s been glued on, I&rsquo;ll bet you we can &nbsp;scrape it off. What do you say?&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c674"><span class="c0">I was carefully talking to him this time so he couldn&#39;t track where I was. I &nbsp;turned my head and talked sideways out of my mouth like one of those &nbsp;ventriloquists. &quot;Just leave them at the side of the road and I&rsquo;ll get them. And &nbsp;please open the bottle of pop, sir, I don&#39;t have a bottle. He squatted back down &nbsp;again and said, &quot;Oh, no, can&#39;t do that. The deal is I feed you, you show me your &nbsp;face.&quot; From the way the man talked he seemed like he was OK and before my &nbsp;brain could stop it my stomach told the rest of me to slide my suitcase deeper </span></p><p class="c731"><span class="c0">into the weeds and walk out. The man stayed squatted down and said, &quot;I knew I &nbsp;saw something. A deal&#39;s a deal so I&#39;ll go get your food, all right?&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c57"><span class="c0">&quot;Yes, sir.&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c681"><span class="c0">He stood up, turned his back to me, then ducked inside the car. A second later &nbsp;he came back with a brown paper bag and a big bottle of red pop. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c23"><span class="c0">&quot;Here it is.&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c309"><span class="c0">He stood there acting like I was going to have to come over to him and get it. &nbsp;&quot;Could you put them down and I&rsquo;ll eat them and you can keep driving, sir?&quot; &nbsp;He laughed again. &quot;Thanks for your concern, but I&#39;ve got a little time to spare.&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c638"><span class="c0">With him standing there in the dark dangling the bottle of red pop out of his &nbsp;right hand and the red taillights of the car behind him shining through the bottle &nbsp;it looked like the reddest red in the world. I walked right up to the man like I &nbsp;was hypnotized. I forgot all my manners and reached right out. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c18"><span class="c0">He raised the bottle over his head. &quot;Hold on now.&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0">&quot;Could I have some of the pop, sir?&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c631"><span class="c0">He smiled. &quot;That&#39;s not why I said hold on, I said it because we have some &nbsp;talking to do first.&#39;&#39; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c254"><span class="c0">My eyes left the bottle and looked at the man. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c663"><span class="c0">His hat wasn&#39;t a cop hat or a soldier hat, it was the kind of cap, men wore who &nbsp;drive fancy cars for rich folks. And it wasn&#39;t black, it was red. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c43"><span class="c0">He said, &quot;I&#39;ve got a problem and I need you to help me figure it out.&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c648"><span class="c0">Uh-oh. What he&#39;d just said is another one of Bud Caldwell&#39;s Rules and Things &nbsp;for Having a Funner Life and Making a Better Liar Out of Yourself. This was &nbsp;Number 87. &nbsp;</span></p><h3 class="c179 c118" id="h.g7ldpeh5dmgh"><span class="c140">RULES AND THINGS NUMBER 87 &nbsp;</span></h3><p class="c36"><span class="c5">When a Adult Tells You They Need Your Help </span></p><p class="c119"><span class="c5">With a Problem Get Ready to Be Tricked&mdash; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c36"><span class="c5">Most Times This Means They Just Want You to &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c36"><span class="c5">Go Fetch Something for Them. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c232"><span class="c0">The man said, &quot;My problem is I&#39;m not quite as brave as you are. I&#39;m feeling &nbsp;very, very uncomfortable standing on the side of the road just outside of &nbsp;Owosso, Michigan, at two-thirty in the morning, and the sooner you can put my &nbsp;mind at ease about what you&#39;re doing out here the sooner we both can go about &nbsp;our business, OK?&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c18"><span class="c0">I nodded. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c69"><span class="c0">He waited a second, then nodded too. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c69"><span class="c0">I nodded back. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c69"><span class="c0">He said, &quot;Well?&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c105"><span class="c0">I was too doggone tired and hungry to think up a good lie. &quot;Nothing, sir.&quot; &nbsp;He looked disappointed. &quot;What&#39;s your name, son?&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c0">&quot;Bud, not Buddy, sir.&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c180"><span class="c0">&quot;Now there&#39;s an unusual name. Did you run away from home, Bud-not Buddy?&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c651"><span class="c0">I could tell this guy was poking fun at me but I answered anyway. &quot;Yes, sir.&quot; &nbsp;&quot;OK, that&#39;s a start.&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c342"><span class="c0">He handed me the bottle of red pop. He must&#39;ve had it sitting in ice in the car, it &nbsp;was cold and sweet and delicious. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c475"><span class="c0">After a couple of seconds he pulled the bottle away from my mouth. &quot;Hold on, &nbsp;hold on, don&#39;t belt it all down on the first pull. There&#39;s plenty here.&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c43"><span class="c0">I slowed way down. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0">&quot;OK, Bud, you&#39;ve run away from home, where is that?&quot; </span></p><p class="c351"><span class="c0">I don&#39;t know if it was because of the red pop juicing up my brain or because I&#39;m &nbsp;such a good liar, but one of those things got me thinking again real quick. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c250"><span class="c0">The first thing I knew was that no matter what I told him this man wasn&#39;t going &nbsp;to let me stay out here by myself, but the nervous way he kept looking around &nbsp;was making things seem so scary that not staying out here was OK. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c571"><span class="c0">The second thing I knew was that I couldn&#39;t tell this man about the Home or the &nbsp;Amoses. I wasn&#39;t about to let him take me back to either one of them. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c18"><span class="c0">The man said, &quot;Where&#39;s home, Bud?&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c48"><span class="c0">Then another jolt of red pop must&#39;ve pumped through my heart because my &nbsp;brain came up with a perfect lie. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c57"><span class="c0">&quot;I ran away from Grand Rapids, sir.&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c415"><span class="c0">See how perfect the lie was? Maybe this guy would feel sorry for me and put &nbsp;me on a bus to Grand Rapids and I wouldn&#39;t have to do any more doggone &nbsp;walking. He must have some money, anyone driving a car like this would have &nbsp;to be rich or at least know somebody who was rich. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c673"><span class="c0">The man scratched under the back of his hat and said, &quot;Grand Rapids!&quot; He said &nbsp;that like it was the most unbelievable thing in the world, like you&#39;d need to put &nbsp;six exclamation points after it. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c0">Something about the way he said it made me nervous but I answered him. &nbsp;&quot;Yes, sir.&quot; That&#39;s the bad thing about lying, once you say one you&#39;ve usually got &nbsp;to stick with it. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c150"><span class="c0">&quot;Well I&rsquo;ll be ...,&quot; the man said. &quot;That&#39;s where I&#39;m from, I left there not an hour &nbsp;and a half ago.&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c225"><span class="c0">He snatched the bottle out of my hand, grabbed my arm, walked me over to the &nbsp;passenger&#39;s side of the car and started to open the door. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c474"><span class="c0">I was glad I was going to be getting a ride but I said, &quot;Sir, I left my suitcase &nbsp;over in the bushes, can we please get it?&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c343"><span class="c0">&quot;See, my eyes aren&#39;t near as bad as I thought they were, I knew you had a box &nbsp;or something. Bud-not- Buddy, you don&#39;t know how lucky you are I came &nbsp;through here, some of these Owosso folks used to have a sign hanging along </span></p><p class="c575"><span class="c0">here that said, and I&#39;m going to clean up the language for you, it said, &#39;To Our &nbsp;Negro Friends Who Are Passing Through, Kindly Don&#39;t Let the Sun Set on &nbsp;Your Rear End in Owosso!&#39; &quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c106"><span class="c0">He must not have trusted me &#39;cause he kept hold of my arm. We went over to &nbsp;the bushes and I grabbed my suitcase. Then he walked me back to the car. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c164"><span class="c0">When he opened the passenger&#39;s side door I could see that there was a big box &nbsp;sitting on the front seat. The man never let go of my arm and wrestled the box &nbsp;over into the backseat. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c231"><span class="c0">If he would&#39;ve let go of my arm for just one second I would&#39;ve run like the devil &nbsp;was chasing me. On the side of the box some big red letters said as clear as &nbsp;anything, URGENT: CONTAINS HUMAN BLOOD!!! &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c689"><span class="c0">Oh, man, here we go again! &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c695"><span class="c0">My heart started jumping around in my stomach. The only kind of people who &nbsp;would carry human blood around in a car were vampires! They must drink it if &nbsp;they were taking a long trip and couldn&#39;t find any people to get blood from. &nbsp;This guy figured he&#39;d rather have my fresh blood than blood out of a bottle! &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c331"><span class="c0">I barely heard him say, &quot;Get in. I&#39;m going back to Grand Rapids tomorrow, I&rsquo;ll &nbsp;send a telegram to your folks and then take you back.&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c709"><span class="c0">Then he made his first mistake, he let go of my arm. I slid into the car and he &nbsp;closed the door behind me. Quick as anything I locked the door and crawled &nbsp;over to the driver&#39;s side of the car and pulled that door closed and locked it just &nbsp;as the vampire reached for the handle to get in. I dug around in my pocket and &nbsp;pulled my knife out and put it under my leg. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c371"><span class="c0">I put my hands on the steering wheel and looked at the gearshift to try to figure &nbsp;which way was &quot;Go.&quot; I stretched my legs out as far as they&#39;d reach and could &nbsp;just get to the gas pedal. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c135"><span class="c0">I pulled the gear lever down and the car took off with the vampire running as &nbsp;hard as he could to catch me. Wow! If I kept things like this up I would knock &nbsp;Baby Face Nelson off the FBI&#39;s ten most wanted list! &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c177"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c190"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><h1 class="c119 c118" id="h.9ofbi5773h7v"><span class="c5">CHAPTER 11 &nbsp;</span></h1><p class="c19"><span class="c0">THE CAR ONLY WENT thirty giant steps before it commenced to bucking &nbsp;and finally cut right off. The vampire guy finally caught up with me. He was &nbsp;looking very surprised, he just tapped on the window with his knuckle. He said, &nbsp;&quot;Roll the window down for a minute, Bud.&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c477"><span class="c0">Sometimes it&#39;s terrible to have been brought up proper. I couldn&#39;t help myself, I &nbsp;rolled the window down just enough so that our words could get in and out but &nbsp;his hand or claws couldn&#39;t. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c18"><span class="c0">He said, &quot;OK, what&#39;s this&#39;!&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c79"><span class="c0">I said, &quot;Don&#39;t you think I can read? How come you&#39;re carrying real human &nbsp;blood around in your car?&quot; I showed him my jackknife. &quot;I&#39;ll warn you, I know &nbsp;how to kill vampires. This knife is genuine solid twenty-four- karat silver.&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c400"><span class="c0">He put both of his hands over his face and shook his head back and forth a &nbsp;couple of times. He said, &quot;Sweet baby Jesus, why me?&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c349"><span class="c0">Then he said, &quot;Bud, if you were from Flint I might think you believe that, but &nbsp;you&#39;re a Grand Rapids boy, you&#39;ve got to be smarter than that. If I was a &nbsp;vampire why have I got that sandwich and bottle of red pop?&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c18"><span class="c0">I thought for a second, then the answer jumped out. &quot;Bait!&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c101"><span class="c0">He put his hands back over his face. This time when he pulled them away he &nbsp;was laughing. He said, &quot;Bud, if I was a vampire I wouldn&#39;t have to catch little &nbsp;boys, I&#39;d just stick my fangs into one of those bottles and have my supper. &nbsp;Besides, where&#39;ve you ever heard of a vampire that knew how to drive a car?&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c282"><span class="c0">That made sense, in all the moving picture shows I&#39;d seen and all the books I&#39;d &nbsp;read about vampires I never could think of seeing one that could drive a car. &nbsp;But I wasn&#39;t going to take any chances. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c23"><span class="c0">&quot;Could I please see your teeth, sir?&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0">&quot;What?&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0">&quot;Your teeth, sir.&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c78"><span class="c0">The man mumbled something, shook his head again, then leaned close to the &nbsp;window glass and opened his mouth. </span></p><p class="c443"><span class="c0">Even though he didn&#39;t have fangs his teeth still looked kinda scary. They &nbsp;looked like they could bite a pretty good grapefruit-sized chunk out of you. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c729"><span class="c0">Then he said, &quot;Bud, I&#39;ve got to get this blood to Hurley Hospital in Flint, they &nbsp;need it right away for someone&#39;s operation. I can look at you and tell you&#39;re far &nbsp;too smart to believe in any nonsense like vampires, son. Be a good boy and &nbsp;open the door.&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c195"><span class="c0">I pulled the lock up for him and scooted over to the passenger&#39;s side of the car. &nbsp;I unlocked my door just in case he had any tricks up his sleeve. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c605"><span class="c0">He got in the car and said, &quot;You&#39;ll never know how grateful I am to you, Bud. &nbsp;I&rsquo;ll take that horrible image of you putting the car in gear to drive away while I &nbsp;stood by the side of the road in Owosso, Michigan, at two- thirty in the &nbsp;morning to my grave with me. Thank God you don&#39;t know how to drive.&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c23"><span class="c0">&quot;No, sir, but if you&#39;da showed me some fangs I&#39;da learned real quick.&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c503"><span class="c0">Just in case, I watched the way he put the car in gear so&#39;s the next time &nbsp;something like this happened I&#39;d know how to make a clean getaway. Me and &nbsp;the man headed back toward Flint, driving over the same road it took me so &nbsp;long to walk. Going like this I wasn&#39;t never going to get away from this &nbsp;doggone city. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c38"><span class="c0">We hadn&#39;t been driving for a minute before he started asking a whole slew of &nbsp;questions. Questions that I had to be very careful about giving the right answers &nbsp;to. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c580"><span class="c0">He said, &quot;Don&#39;t you feel bad about worrying your mother like this, Bud-not Buddy?&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c50"><span class="c0">&quot;My mother is dead, sir.&quot; Most times if you tell a adult that they&#39;ll leave you &nbsp;alone, but not this man. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c240"><span class="c0">&quot;What? I&#39;m sorry to hear that, Bud. So you stay with your daddy?&quot; &nbsp;&quot;Yes, sir.&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c0">&quot;Right in Grand Rapids?&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0">&quot;Yes, sir.&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0">&quot;What&#39;s his name, does he work for the railroad?&quot; </span></p><p class="c88"><span class="c0">&quot;No, sir.&quot; The seed started sticking its head out further and further. &quot;His name &nbsp;is Herman E. Calloway and he plays the biggest doggone fiddle you&#39;ll ever &nbsp;see.&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c18"><span class="c0">The man shouted, &quot;What?&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c618"><span class="c0">I said, &quot;Really, sir, I swear &#39;fore God it&#39;s the biggest fiddle in the world&quot; &nbsp;He said, &quot;I know your father, everybody in Grand Rapids does.&quot; &nbsp;I didn&#39;t say anything. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c149"><span class="c0">He said, &quot;Well, I&rsquo;ll be. You know, at first glimpse I wouldn&#39;t say you look that &nbsp;much like Herman, but now that I look at you I suppose you do. Of course he&#39;s &nbsp;quite a bit bigger, if you know what I mean.&quot; This was the best news I&#39;d had all &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c732"><span class="c0">day, my face nearly split in half from my giant smile. &quot;Yes, sir, folks say I&#39;m &nbsp;the spitting image of my old man.&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c196"><span class="c0">He really started shooting the questions at me so to stop him I said, &quot;Sir, could I &nbsp;please have the sandwich and the rest of the red pop before I answer any more &nbsp;questions?&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c530"><span class="c0">He slapped his forehead and said, &quot;Oh, I&#39;m sorry, Bud, I was so surprised about &nbsp;who you are and so happy that you didn&#39;t drive off that I forgot all about our &nbsp;deal.&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c529"><span class="c0">He handed me the sandwich and the pop and the apple. I was so hungry that I &nbsp;forgot all about scraping the mustard off the baloney sandwich and even like &nbsp;that it was the best sandwich I&#39;d ever had in my life. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c255"><span class="c0">&quot;Bud&quot; he said, &quot;my name&#39;s Mr. Lewis. Now if you were about fifteen, twenty &nbsp;years older you could call me Lefty. But you&#39;re not, so you can&#39;t. Mr. Lewis &nbsp;will do just fine.&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c175"><span class="c0">I shoved the part of the sandwich that I was chewing into the side of my mouth &nbsp;so I could say, &quot;Yes, sir, Mr. Lewis, sir.&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c337"><span class="c0">He said, &quot;I&#39;m not ashamed to admit it, you gave me a scare here tonight that I&rsquo;ll &nbsp;never forget. I just know I&rsquo;ll be having nightmares about meeting you for the &nbsp;rest of my life. I&rsquo;ll wake up in a cold sweat many a night with the picture of &nbsp;you and my car pulling away with that blood on the seat. </span></p><p class="c215"><span class="c0">&quot;I can see it all now, I&rsquo;ll be sound asleep, deep in the middle of a Ruth &nbsp;Dandridge dream, when all of a sudden I&rsquo;ll be standing on the side of the road &nbsp;in Owosso, Michigan, at two-thirty in the morning and I&rsquo;ll be seeing my car &nbsp;and that blood pulling away with nothing of you showing but that little peanut head of yours peeking up over the dash.&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c18"><span class="c0">He looked at me out of the side of his eye. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c324"><span class="c0">&quot;Anyone ever tell you you&#39;ve got a little peanut-head?&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c265"><span class="c0">I gulped down the pop I&#39;d been swishing around in my mouth and said, &quot;No, &nbsp;sir.&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c237"><span class="c0">&quot;Well,&quot; he said, &quot;this may be the first time but unless you undergo some major &nbsp;surgery I&rsquo;ll bet it won&#39;t be the last.&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c57"><span class="c0">&quot;Yes, sir.&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c545"><span class="c0">He waited a second, then sounded kind of disappointed when he said, &quot;Don&#39;t &nbsp;take it so seriously, Bud, I am teasing, you know.&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c18"><span class="c0">I started in on the apple. &quot;Yes, sir.&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0">&quot;Ever been in the army, Bud?&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0">&quot;No, sir.&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c601"><span class="c0">&quot;Well, I&#39;ve got to tell you, I haven&#39;t heard so many &#39;sirs&#39; since I was back at Fort &nbsp;Gordon in Georgia training for the Big War.&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c43"><span class="c0">I almost said, &quot;Yes, sir,&quot; but I looked at him and guessed he was still teasing. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c204"><span class="c0">I took another drink of the red pop and saw that when I was raising the bottle &nbsp;I&#39;d accidentally let some of the sandwich slip out of my mouth down into the &nbsp;pop. There were a couple of chunks of chewed-up bread, a blob of baloney and &nbsp;some of the mustard swimming around in the bottle. The mustard was real &nbsp;pretty, it looked like some kind of magical fog, every time I moved the bottle &nbsp;the mustardy smoke went into a different kind of shape. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c0">Lefty Lewis said, &quot;How about sharing that pop, Bud?&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c89"><span class="c0">Uh-oh. He took one look and handed it back. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He said, &quot;Nothing personal, Bud, I&#39;ve raised three kids and have two grandkids, &nbsp;I&#39;ve learned the hard way about drinking after young folks. But I do believe you &nbsp;need to get in and see a doctor soon, son, it looks to me like you&#39;ve got a &nbsp;serious backwash problem, that&#39;s the most food I&#39;ve ever seen floating around &nbsp;in a bottle of pop. In fact, that doesn&#39;t look like red pop anymore, it looks more &nbsp;like red stew.&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c170"><span class="c0">I real quick chugged the rest of the pop down and ate the apple real slow &nbsp;because I figured as soon as I was done with it the questions would start up &nbsp;again. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c201"><span class="c0">Lefty Lewis said, &quot;Aren&#39;t you sleepy?&quot; This was perfect! I could pretend I was &nbsp;falling asleep and then come up with some answers that would get me to Grand &nbsp;Rapids for sure. I yawned real big. &quot;A little bit, sir.&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c363"><span class="c0">&quot;All right, here, give me that core, I think the only thing that&#39;s left is a seed or &nbsp;two anyway.&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c525"><span class="c0">I handed him the apple core and he put it and the wax paper from the sandwich &nbsp;in the paper bag. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c261"><span class="c0">&quot;You just stretch out there and have some sleep. In about an hour you&#39;ll be in a &nbsp;nice comfortable bed. We can have our talk in the morning.&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c266"><span class="c0">He reached in the backseat and said, &quot;Here&quot; and handed me a jacket. &quot;You can &nbsp;use this for a blanket.&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c43"><span class="c0">The jacket smelled real good, like spice and soap. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c176"><span class="c0">Lefty Lewis said, &quot;Oh, Bud-not-Buddy, one more thing before you doze off. &nbsp;Could you reach over into that box and hand me one of those bottles of blood? I &nbsp;haven&#39;t had a bite to eat all day.&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c476"><span class="c0">I kept my eyes closed and smiled. I knew I was going to be safe, because I&#39;d &nbsp;never heard of a vampire that could drive a car and I&#39;d never seen one that had &nbsp;such a good sense of humor. Besides, I kept my jackknife open under my leg &nbsp;and he looked like he&#39;d believed me when I told him it was made out of real &nbsp;silver, even though it probably wasn&#39;t. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c426"><span class="c0">As soon as I had the jacket over me the smell of the spice and soap and the &nbsp;sound of the crickets and toady- frogs outside made my eyes get real heavy. </span></p><p class="c459"><span class="c0">Wow! I must have been real, real tired. Walking and ducking in and out of the &nbsp;bushes between Flint and Owosso was a lot more work than I thought it was. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c413"><span class="c0">Most of the time since Momma died, if someone even walks close to where I&#39;m &nbsp;sleeping I&#39;m up in a flash, my eyes fly open and I&#39;m looking right at them. At &nbsp;one of the foster houses where I&#39;d stayed a woman told me she knew I was &nbsp;going to be a criminal because &quot;anyone who sleeps that light has got to have a &nbsp;guilty conscience.&quot; Most of the time the sound of someone else going from &nbsp;sleep breathing to awake breathing in the same room as me is enough to get me &nbsp;up. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c171"><span class="c0">But this morning I felt like I was at the bottom of a well that someone had filled &nbsp;with tons of thick chocolate pudding. Someone was calling my name from way &nbsp;up at the top of the well. She was saying, &quot;Bud. Bud. Bud.&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c694"><span class="c0">Waves from the pudding were slogging me back and forth, back and forth. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c528"><span class="c0">&quot;Bud. Wake up, Bud.&quot; It was a woman&#39;s voice and her hands were trying to &nbsp;shake me awake. Uh-oh. This is Number 29 of my rules: &nbsp;</span></p><h3 class="c118 c179" id="h.c1qxf25sxgct"><span class="c140">RULES AND THINGS NUMBER 29 &nbsp;</span></h3><p class="c36"><span class="c5">When You Wake Up and Don&#39;t Know for Sure &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c36"><span class="c5">Where You&#39;re. At end There&#39;s a Bunch of people &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c36"><span class="c5">Standing Around You. It&#39;s Best to pretend &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c36"><span class="c5">You&#39;re Still Asleep, Until You Can Figure &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c36"><span class="c5">Out What&#39;s Going On and What You Should Do. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c69"><span class="c0">I kept my eyes closed, acting like I was out cold. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c578"><span class="c0">The woman said, &quot;Poppa, what on earth are all these lumps and bites on this &nbsp;baby&#39;s face?&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c235"><span class="c0">A man answered, &quot;Well, he was walking all the way From Grand Rapids to &nbsp;Flint, it looks like he provided a pretty paltry meal for every mosquito on the &nbsp;way.&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c564"><span class="c0">The woman said, &quot;This poor child must be dead. I hate getting him up. I wish &nbsp;he could stay with us for a while, at least until he&#39;s had his sleep.&quot; </span></p><p class="c726"><span class="c0">Then I remembered who I was with because Lefty Lewis said, &quot;I know, but I&#39;ve &nbsp;got to get back. He can sleep in the car on the way back to Grand Rapids.&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c607"><span class="c0">The woman rolled back the blanket they&#39;d put over me and said, &quot;Poppa, look &nbsp;at his legs, this boy&#39;s as skinny as a rail.&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c420"><span class="c0">Shucks, they&#39;d taken off my knickers when they put me in this bed. Now I was &nbsp;going to have to pretend I was asleep even longer, at least until I could figure a &nbsp;way out of being so embarrassed. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c110"><span class="c0">Lefty Lewis said, &quot;Yeah, he&#39;s puny. Good thing his legs don&#39;t touch when he &nbsp;walks &#39;cause if those two twigs got to rubbing against one another he&#39;d have a &nbsp;fire going in no time.&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c438"><span class="c0">The woman said, &quot;That&#39;s not funny. He doesn&#39;t look like he&#39;s been fed right. &nbsp;Now who&#39;s his father again, you said you know him?&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c451"><span class="c0">&quot;Everyone in Grand Rapids does, I&#39;m surprised you can&#39;t remember him. He&#39;s &nbsp;quite a big fish there.&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c429"><span class="c0">See! I told you it was smart to pretend you were asleep some of the time. Now I &nbsp;was going to learn some things about my father. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c557"><span class="c0">The woman said, &quot;What kind of man is he that he let this child be so thin? And &nbsp;look at the condition of the boy&#39;s clothes. Everything is either too small for him &nbsp;or almost in tatters. Where is this child&#39;s mother? There&#39;s not much of a &nbsp;woman&#39;s touch about him.&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c319"><span class="c0">Lefty Lewis said, &quot;It seems to me that the Mrs. Calloway I knew passed a long &nbsp;time ago. The boy says he&#39;s ten and I&#39;m sure she died quite a while before that. &nbsp;But you know how musicians are, there must be at least a few Mrs. Calloways I &nbsp;don&#39;t know anything about.&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c18"><span class="c0">That meant that my dad was married to someone before he married my mom. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c697"><span class="c0">Lefty Lewis&#39;s daughter said, &quot;Well, I think it&#39;s a sin. I&#39;m of half a mind to keep &nbsp;this boy for a while to put some fear in his daddy&#39;s heart. But he probably &nbsp;wouldn&#39;t even miss him.&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c421"><span class="c0">Lefty Lewis said, &quot;Now you stop being so judgmental, Herman&#39;s got a &nbsp;reputation for being no-nonsense, not mean.&quot; </span></p><p class="c86"><span class="c0">&quot;Does this child have any brothers or sisters?&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c259"><span class="c0">&quot;I believe he&#39;s got a sister, but she&#39;d have to be his half-sister, she must be full grown by now.&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c391"><span class="c0">The woman pulled the blanket back over my legs and shook me again. I was &nbsp;glad I could stop pretending I was asleep, I was sick and tired of hearing about &nbsp;how skinny I am and what a mixed-up family I come from. She said real soft, &nbsp;&quot;Bud, wake up. Come on, sweetie, I&#39;ve got a nice breakfast waiting for you.&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c28"><span class="c0">Food! I started blinking and acting like those were the first words I&#39;d heard that &nbsp;morning. I said, &quot;Huh?&quot; like I was kind of confused. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c365"><span class="c0">The woman smiled real big and said, &quot;Oh-he, I see that got your attention, &nbsp;didn&#39;t it? Good morning, young man.&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c57"><span class="c0">&quot;Good morning, ma&#39;am. Good morning, Mr. Lewis.&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c216"><span class="c0">He said, &quot;Hey, you remembered my name, I&#39;m impressed. Good morning, &nbsp;Walking Willie. We&#39;ve got to hit the road in a bit, better hurry up and get some &nbsp;food in your belly.&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c725"><span class="c0">He acted like he was whispering just to me when he said, &quot;The food in this joint &nbsp;ain&#39;t the best, but I guarantee after you eat here you won&#39;t be hungry for days, &nbsp;this meal&#39;s going to be sitting on your stomach like a rock for a good long &nbsp;time.&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c652"><span class="c0">The woman said, &quot;Ignore him, Bud. My father doesn&#39;t mean anything, he just &nbsp;can&#39;t stop teasing.&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c18"><span class="c0">I said, &quot;I know, ma&#39;am, he told me I&#39;ve got a head shaped like a peanut.&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c341"><span class="c0">The woman slapped her father on the arm. &quot;Poppa! I can&#39;t believe you&#39;ve teased &nbsp;this child already. What is on your mind?&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c516"><span class="c0">Lefty Lewis rubbed his hand over my head and said, &quot;Look at this noggin, I rest &nbsp;my case. Boy looks like one of George Washington Carver&#39;s experiments &nbsp;sprouted legs and run off. You sure you&#39;re not from Tuskegee, Alabama, Bud?&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c18"><span class="c0">I said. &quot;No. sir.&quot; </span></p><p class="c488"><span class="c0">The woman sucked in her lower lip and swallowed a smile before she said, &nbsp;&quot;See, Bud, he can&#39;t help himself. But he really doesn&#39;t mean anything, do you, &nbsp;Poppa?&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c531"><span class="c0">The way she asked that you&#39;d have to be pretty stupid not to know how to &nbsp;answer her. Lefty Lewis said, &quot;Not a thing. It&#39;s just that you--&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c43"><span class="c0">His daughter spoke up. &quot;My name is Mrs. Sleet, Bud.&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0">&quot;Pleased to meet you, ma&#39;am.&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c440"><span class="c0">&quot;Now, while you wash up I&#39;m going to go get some clothes that my boy &nbsp;outgrew a while ago, barely been used. So when you get dressed you come on &nbsp;down and we&#39;ll eat, you chose a great day to visit, we&#39;re having a very special &nbsp;breakfast today--pancakes, sausages and toast and a big glass of orange juice. &nbsp;You can meet Scott and Kim, too. How&#39;s that sound?&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c23"><span class="c0">&quot;That sounds real good, ma&#39;am. Thank you very much.&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0">&quot;Don&#39;t mention it, it&#39;s a pleasure to have such a well- mannered young visitor.&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c230"><span class="c0">Mrs. Sleet and Lefty Lewis left the room. As soon as they were a little bit down &nbsp;the hall I could hear her start in on scolding her father again. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c57"><span class="c0">&quot;I just can&#39;t believe it. You know, Momma was right about you. .. .&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c68"><span class="c0">All I could hear next was him mumbling some answer, then her slapping his &nbsp;arm again. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c374"><span class="c0">After I got out of the bathroom, I saw that Mrs. Sleet had put some clean &nbsp;clothes on the bed. My old clothes were gone, all except for my drawers which &nbsp;I hadn&#39;t taken off. She&#39;d even put clean drawers out for me so when I put them &nbsp;on I stuck my old ones down in the pocket of my new pants. I could ditch them &nbsp;when I got to Grand Rapids. It&#39;s too embarrassing to have strangers look at your &nbsp;dirty drawers, even if the stranger is as nice as Mrs. Sleet. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c581"><span class="c0">The new clothes were just a little bit too big, but they were long pants and not &nbsp;knickers so I didn&#39;t care, I rolled cuffs into the pants and sleeves and they fit &nbsp;pretty doggone good. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c0">Man, my first pair of trousers! </span></p><p class="c723"><span class="c0">I let my nose lead me down to where the smell of pancakes and toast was &nbsp;coming from. The Sleets had a room for eating and it had a great big table right &nbsp;in the middle of it. The first thing I noticed was a huge pile of pancakes sitting &nbsp;on a blue and white plate on top of the table. Lefty Lewis was sitting with Mrs. &nbsp;Sleet&#39;s kids. The little girl had a big smile and the boy was looking at me kind &nbsp;of hard. It wasn&#39;t one of those put-up-your-dukes looks, it was just a look like &nbsp;one dog gives another dog that might be passing through his neighborhood. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c169"><span class="c0">Lefty Lewis said, &quot;Bud, these two worrisome midgets are my favorite &nbsp;grandkids. Kim is my favorite grand-daughter and Scott is my favorite &nbsp;grandson. Of course they&#39;re my only grandkids, so in fairness you&#39;d have to say &nbsp;they&#39;re also my least favorite grandkids&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c404"><span class="c0">These two kids had had a lot of practice being around their teasing old &nbsp;granddad because they didn&#39;t pay him no mind at all. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c18"><span class="c0">I said, &quot;Hi, my name is Bud, not Buddy.&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c97"><span class="c0">The little girl said, &quot;That&#39;s a strange name, Bud-not- Buddy&rdquo; and even though &nbsp;she was kind of young and scrawny to be teasing folks I could tell that that was &nbsp;exactly what she was doing. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c254"><span class="c0">Lefty Lewis laughed and said, &quot;That&#39;s my girl&quot; then he went into the kitchen. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c257"><span class="c0">Scott looked up to make sure the grown folks weren&#39;t around and said, &quot;You &nbsp;really run away from home?&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c44"><span class="c0">I had to stop and think, it&#39;s one thing to lie to a grown-up, most times adults &nbsp;want to hear something that lets them take their attention off you and put it on &nbsp;something else. That makes it easy and not too bad to lie to them. You&#39;re really &nbsp;just giving them what they want. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c588"><span class="c0">It&#39;s different when you lie to another kid. Most times kids really do want to &nbsp;know what they&#39;re asking you. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c168"><span class="c0">I guess I&#39;d been thinking too long &#39;cause he said, &quot;You run all the way from &nbsp;Grand Rapids to Owosso? Was it &#39;cause your daddy use to beat you?&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c293"><span class="c0">I could answer that with the swear-&#39;fore-God truth. &quot;Shucks, my daddy never &nbsp;laid a hand on me in his life.&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c57"><span class="c0">&quot;Then how come you run?&quot; </span></p><p class="c86"><span class="c0">&quot;I didn&#39;t like where I was.&quot; That wasn&#39;t a lie. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c671"><span class="c0">&quot;Well, if you&#39;re lying about your daddy beating you, you better scram right &nbsp;after breakfast &#39;cause my gramps is taking you straight back home.&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c57"><span class="c0">&quot;My daddy never laid a hand on me.&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c72"><span class="c0">The little girl said, &quot;Scott, you talk too much, let him sit down.&quot; Then she told &nbsp;me, &quot;Momma&#39;s gonna be bringing the sausages in a minute, you like sausages?&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c437"><span class="c0">&quot;Uh-huh.&quot; I&#39;d never had sausages before but if that was what was making the &nbsp;house smell so good I was going to love it. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c585"><span class="c0">Kim said, &quot;good, &#39;cause my grampa brought them all the way from Grand &nbsp;Rapids. He always brings us good food and we&#39;re going to share it with you &nbsp;&#39;cause Momma says you&#39;re our special guest and we have to treat you nice. Am &nbsp;I being nice?&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c23"><span class="c0">&quot;So far.&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0">&quot;Good. I&rsquo;ll make a deal with you.&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c89"><span class="c0">Uh-oh. &quot;What kind of a deal?&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c657"><span class="c0">&quot;I&rsquo;ll sing a song that I made up all by myself and when I&#39;m done I get to ask &nbsp;you one question and you have to answer and cross your heart you&#39;ll tell the &nbsp;truth&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c18"><span class="c0">This didn&#39;t sound too bad. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0">&quot;OK.&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c493"><span class="c0">&quot;Here goes, it took me a very long time to make this song up, so I hope you like &nbsp;it.&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c18"><span class="c0">The boy said, &quot;Oh, brother!&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c479"><span class="c0">Kim sang, &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c36"><span class="c5">&quot;Mommy says no &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c36"><span class="c5">Mommy says no, </span></p><p class="c119"><span class="c5">I listen, you don &#39;t, &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c36"><span class="c5">Wha-ha-ha-ha. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c36"><span class="c5">The building falls down, &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c36"><span class="c5">The building falls down, &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c36"><span class="c5">You get crushed, I don &#39;t, &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c36"><span class="c5">Wha-ha-ha-ha.&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c139"><span class="c0">Boy. That was about the worst song I&#39;d ever heard. Kim stood up and bowed &nbsp;like a princess. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c18"><span class="c0">I clapped my hands together kind of soft under the table. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c103"><span class="c0">She said, &quot;Thank you very much.&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c103"><span class="c0">Scott just shook his head. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c362"><span class="c0">Kim said, &quot;OK, that&#39;s my part of the deal, now you&#39;ve got to keep your part and &nbsp;answer any question I ask.&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c57"><span class="c0">&quot;OK.&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0">&quot;Now you can tell me all about how your mother died.&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c103"><span class="c0">Scott&#39;s foot kicked at her under the table. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c411"><span class="c0">I said, &quot;Who told you my momma died?&quot; The little girl said, &quot;Oops&quot; and &nbsp;stuffed something from her hand into her mouth. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c151"><span class="c0">&quot;My momma got sick. She died real fast. She didn&#39;t feel no pain or no &nbsp;suffering.&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c76"><span class="c0">Kim said, &quot;I hope my mother never dies.&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c103"><span class="c0">Scott said, &quot;Stupid, everybody&#39;s got to die.&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c479"><span class="c0">Kim said, &quot;Ooh, I&#39;m telling Momma you called me stupid.&quot; </span></p><p class="c680"><span class="c0">He said, &quot;You do and I&rsquo;ll tell her that you&#39;ve got one of those pancakes in the &nbsp;pocket of your dress.&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c55"><span class="c0">She shut right up. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c210"><span class="c0">I told her, &quot;He&#39;s right, everybody&#39;s got to die. It&#39;s not sad unless they do it real &nbsp;slow and suffer. My momma died so quick and painless that she didn&#39;t even &nbsp;have time to close her eyes, she didn&#39;t even have time to make a face like she &nbsp;was hurting.&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c18"><span class="c0">Both of Lefty Lewis&#39;s grandkids looked real surprised at this news. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c684"><span class="c0">Mrs. Sleet came into the room with another blue plate, covered with little round &nbsp;pieces of meat. Those had to be the sausages. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c414"><span class="c0">She saw the way her kids were looking at me with their mouths half opened &nbsp;and said, &quot;Now you two aren&#39;t talking Bud&#39;s ear off, are you?&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c514"><span class="c0">Scott said, &quot;No, Momma, I&#39;m not, but Kim&#39;s coming real close to.&quot; &nbsp;Kim said, &quot;I was not, I was just making pleasant conversation.&quot; &nbsp;Mrs. Sleet laughed and set the plate on the table right in Front of me. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c521"><span class="c0">Lefty Lewis came out with a big glass jug filled with orange juice and sat down &nbsp;next to me. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c659"><span class="c0">Mrs. Sleet sat down and said, &quot;Scott and Kim, would you say the grace, &nbsp;please?&#39;&#39; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c59"><span class="c0">Everyone ducked their heads down and the two kids said, &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c36"><span class="c5">&quot;God is great, &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c36"><span class="c5">God is good, &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c36"><span class="c5">Let us thank him &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c36"><span class="c5">For our food. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c36"><span class="c5">Amen. &quot; </span></p><p class="c275"><span class="c0">Then people started passing the big blue plates around and stabbing toast and &nbsp;pancakes and sausages with their forks. I watched to see how much everyone &nbsp;took and tried to take the same. Then I started to watch how much food the two &nbsp;kids put on their fork every time so I wouldn&#39;t look like a pig. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c591"><span class="c0">Lefty Lewis noticed I was taking a long time and told his daughter, &quot;See what I &nbsp;told you, Nina, poor Bud-not- Buddy is so skinny and his stomach has shrunk &nbsp;down so much that just smelling the food has got the boy full. Oh, well, I guess &nbsp;that just means more food for the rest of us.&quot; Everyone except for me and Mrs. &nbsp;Sleet yelled a big cheer. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c728"><span class="c0">Eating with the Sleets and Lefty Lewis was really hard to do, not because they &nbsp;had bad table manners or nothing, but because they talked through the whole &nbsp;breakfast. And they kept trying to get me to talk too. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c156"><span class="c0">At the Home after grace was said we weren&#39;t allowed to say boo. Eating and &nbsp;being quiet is a hard habit to break. Every time one of these Sleets would talk &nbsp;to me and look at me like they expected a answer I&rsquo;d look around first to make &nbsp;sure no one was watching. At the Home if you got caught talking during &nbsp;mealtime you&#39;d have to get up and leave your food. If these Sleets had to live &nbsp;under those rules they&#39;d all starve to death. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c517"><span class="c0">They talked after every swallow, they talked after every drink they took, they &nbsp;talked whilst they were wiping off their lips. Shucks, the little girl, Kim, talked &nbsp;with milk running down her throat, some of the time her words got gluggled up &nbsp;in what she was swallowing. And they laughed. Man, did they laugh. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c291"><span class="c0">It was hard to tell whose story they were laughing at, they were doing so much &nbsp;chattering. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c510"><span class="c0">Lefty Lewis was talking about radio shows and Scott was talking about going &nbsp;to a baseball game to watch Lefty Lewis pitch and Kim was talking about a &nbsp;little girl she didn&#39;t like and Mrs. Sleet was talking about some people called &nbsp;redcaps. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c248"><span class="c0">Kim said to her mother, &quot;Mommy, can&#39;t you tell that Bud-not-Buddy doesn&#39;t &nbsp;know what a redcap is, you gotta explain better.&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c397"><span class="c0">Mrs. Sleet said, &quot;Oh, sorry, Bud, redcaps are the men who work at the railroad &nbsp;station loading the trains and taking people&#39;s bags to their cars. That&#39;s what Mr. &nbsp;Lewis does. My husband is a Pullman porter, he takes care of the people once &nbsp;they&#39;re on the trains.&quot; </span></p><p class="c704"><span class="c0">Kim said, &quot;Yeah, our dad gets to travel all over the country on trains for free!&quot; &nbsp;Scott said, &quot;That&#39;s &#39;cause he&#39;s working, it&#39;s not for free, he gets paid to do it.&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c537"><span class="c0">Lefty Lewis swallowed a big hunk of sausage and said, &quot;And you know what, &nbsp;Bud? I bet the thing he misses most is Nina&#39;s cooking. I can&#39;t tell you how &nbsp;proud I am of how far my daughter&#39;s cooking has come. This might be hard to &nbsp;believe, but she used to be such a bad cook that her fried chicken was known to &nbsp;have turned a chicken hawk into a vegetarian.&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c117"><span class="c0">Scott and Kim and Mrs. Sleet started busting a gut. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c213"><span class="c0">&quot;Yup! Lefty Lewis said, &quot;I brought a friend to Flint a couple of years ago and &nbsp;even though I&#39;d warned him he tried to be polite and ate four of her pancakes. &nbsp;Pour soul held his stomach all the way back to Grand Rapids. Said to me, &nbsp;&#39;Lefty, I don&#39;t mean to show any disrespect, but those weren&#39;t pancakes your &nbsp;daughter served me, they were paincakes.&#39; &quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c714"><span class="c0">Mrs. Sleet laughed along with everyone else and said, &quot;Well, I&#39;m sure I don&#39;t &nbsp;need to hear any more of this&quot; and picked up the empty sausage plate and went &nbsp;into the kitchen. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c304"><span class="c0">As soon as she got out of the room Kim whispered, &quot;Quick, Grampa, tell Bud not-Buddy how many times you had to pull the car over when you two were &nbsp;going back to Grand Rapids so that man could get out and vomick on the side &nbsp;of the road.&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c441"><span class="c0">Before Lefty Lewis could answer, Mrs. Sleet came out of the kitchen with a big &nbsp;wooden spoon and whopped her father a good lick in the head. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c323"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><h1 class="c36 c118" id="h.t6pmajoge3h2"><span class="c5">CHAPTER 12 &nbsp;</span></h1><p class="c13"><span class="c0">AFTER BREAKFAST me and Mr. Lewis said goodbye to the Sleets and got &nbsp;back into the car. I leaned over the front seat to put my suitcase in the back. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c23"><span class="c0">&quot;Mr. Lewis, someone stole all the blood last night!&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c465"><span class="c0">He said, &quot;I&rsquo;ll say one thing for you, Bud, when you go to sleep you go way, &nbsp;way to sleep. You don&#39;t remember anything about last night after we got to &nbsp;Flint?&quot; </span></p><p class="c46"><span class="c0">I said, &quot;I don&#39;t think so, sir.&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c123"><span class="c0">&quot;After you so rudely fell asleep on me we dropped the blood off at Hurley &nbsp;Hospital, then I gassed up, then I got in touch with your daddy to let him know &nbsp;you were all right.&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c0">Uh-oh. &quot;What did he say, sir?&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c67"><span class="c0">&quot;I didn&#39;t call him, I sent a telegram to the Log Cabin. He still owns that club, &nbsp;doesn&#39;t he?&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c57"><span class="c0">&quot;Yes, sir.&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c223"><span class="c0">&quot;Good.&quot; Lefty Lewis leaned over and reached in the glove box of the car. He &nbsp;pulled out a flimsy piece of yellow paper and handed it to me. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c224"><span class="c0">Across the top of the paper it said in big letters, WESTERN UNION. &nbsp;Underneath that it said, &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c43"><span class="c0">HEC STOP &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c69"><span class="c0">BUD OK IN FLINT STOP AT 4309 NORTH ST &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c103"><span class="c0">STOP RETURN 8PM WED STOP &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c89"><span class="c0">LEFTY STOP &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c165"><span class="c0">Man! I&rsquo;ll bet Herman E. Calloway was just as confused by this message as I &nbsp;was. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c18"><span class="c0">I said, &quot;What does this mean, sir?&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c66"><span class="c0">Lefty Lewis said, &quot;When you send a telegram the more letters you use the more &nbsp;money you have to pay, so you try to keep your messages as short as you can. &nbsp;Here, let me see it.&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c43"><span class="c0">I handed him the paper. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c644"><span class="c0">He said, &quot;OK, &#39;HEC,&#39; that stands for your dad, Herman E. Calloway. &#39;Bud OK &nbsp;in Flint,&#39; that lets him know how far you got and that you&#39;re safe.
